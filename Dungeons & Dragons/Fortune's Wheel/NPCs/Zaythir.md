# Zaythir, Elder Githzerai
<img src="Zaythir.webp" class="rightimg" height=600>

**Zaythir** is the current caretaker and resident sage of the walking castle Iedcaru, a legendary githzerai construct designed as a hermitage for ascetics to study and meditate on the nature of the Outer Planes. She is described as an **elder githzerai**, patient and reserved, who has lived alone in the castle for years, safeguarding its legacy and knowledge.

## Relationship with the Githzerai in the Sarcophagus

Within Iedcaru’s library lies a crystal sarcophagus containing the mummified remains of **Laxuelu**, the castle’s first caretaker, whose name is etched on the lid. Zaythir is a successor in a long line of scholarly guardians. She honors the traditions and responsibilities established by Laxuelu and the original githzerai ascetics who created Iedcaru as a moving sanctuary for contemplation and learning.

## Zaythir’s Story

Zaythir’s history is one of **solitude and dedication**. She has spent years alone in the castle, maintaining its function as a repository of planar knowledge and a place of meditation. The castle, once bustling with githzerai scholars, has become quiet under her stewardship, a fact she acknowledges with a hint of regret, noting that if there had been more defenders, the recent fiendish incursion might have been prevented3. Despite this, she remains committed to her role, even after being captured by fiends and later rescued by adventurers.

## Goals and Motivations

Zaythir’s goals are scholarly and custodial:

- **Preserve and expand knowledge** of the Outer Planes, continuing the hermitage’s original purpose.
    
- **Protect Iedcaru** and its resources, ensuring it remains a sanctuary for planar study.
    
- **Assist worthy travelers**: After being freed, she expresses gratitude and offers the castle as a base for adventurers exploring the Outlands, sharing her knowledge and resources freely[4](https://reservation.gameforce.nl/gamedays/details/2c5beaca-c662-42cb-80ab-8701f381b2ab).
    
- **Restore Iedcaru’s legacy**: She is motivated to see the castle returned to its proper use, possibly hoping to attract new scholars or allies to prevent future threats.
    

Zaythir is not depicted as a warrior or a leader of githzerai society, but rather as a **dedicated scholar and caretaker**, embodying the contemplative ideals of her people and the castle’s founders. Her connection to Laxuelu is one of tradition and shared purpose, carrying forward the torch of planar inquiry and guardianship

### Meeting R04M

Zaythir was recently visited by a monodrone who called himself [[R04M]]. He had been using a mimir to follow the path of the last Great Modron March, intending to learn truths of the multiverse. He left his mimir here, saying it told him where to go after visiting all the gate-towns (though he didn’t say where that was). His mimir was damaged during the Fiends’ attack.

Zaythir knows nothing about the multiversal glitch affecting the characters, but she’s happy to let them research in the castle’s library. Unfortunately, the
library contains no information on the characters’ circumstances.

> "Ah, the little sphere. It called itself R04M. It arrived at Iedcaru some time ago, before the fiends came.
> It was not here to study me or the castle in the way a scholar would. It claimed to be on a mission of profound importance: to trace the path of the last Great Modron March. Its purpose was to gather residual data. It carried a unique Mimir—a skull that seemed to serve as both its map and its data repository.
> The creature itself was... peculiar. More adorned than a typical monodrone. Already it bore those mismatched wings, a design it described as 'optimized for varied planar gravities and atmospheric compositions.'
> It completed its analysis here and announced its Mimir had calculated its next destination—a place of great chaos, it noted with a logical shudder. It did not name the place. Citing protocol for safeguarding critical data before entering a hostile environment, it asked to leave its Mimir in my care. A logical, if unusual, request.
> I agreed. Then the fiends attacked. The Mimir was damaged in the chaos, a crack across its cranium. The monodrone never returned for it. To my knowledge, it proceeded to its next destination. What became of it after that, I cannot say. It was a strange, driven little creature."

### Quotes

**On the Outlands**

> “The Outlands are a tapestry of paradoxes. Here, every path leads outward and inward at once, and truths are as mutable as the winds. I have spent decades seeking patterns in the chaos, and still, the center eludes me.”

**On the Fiends**

> “The fiends were drawn by ambition and ignorance. They see Iedcaru as a weapon or a prize, not as the sanctuary of contemplation it was meant to be. Their presence was a blight upon these halls.”

**On Her Imprisonment**

> “They locked me away as one might lock away a book they cannot read, hoping that time or violence would reveal my secrets. I endured, as stone endures the storm.”

**On Her Backstory**

> “I am Zaythir, last of Iedcaru’s stewards. I have watched over these halls since memory faded for most of my kin. My purpose is to preserve what was entrusted to me, and to seek understanding of the realms beyond our own.”

**On Her Goals**

> “I wish only for Iedcaru to serve its purpose once more—a beacon for those who seek knowledge, not conquest. If you share that aim, my wisdom and this castle are yours to use.”
