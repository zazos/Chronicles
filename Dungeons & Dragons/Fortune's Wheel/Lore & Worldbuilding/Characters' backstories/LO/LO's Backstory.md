The smell of moss and rain are the first two things I can remember my senses picking up. Of course what I considered the smell of rain I learnt later in life was the smell of ozone interacting with the air as electric currents coalesce….eh yeah anyway. 

Quite the unfortunate little being I was, naked and frail in my cell. The Master presented himself unto me and gave me my only possession, a locket inscribed with the word LO. He took me by the hand, the oh great Master that he was. He taught me lots of things, what he called science and magic. It wasn’t everything he could teach me but it was adequate. Quickly I grasped the concepts of Alchemy, Infusion, Forgery and Transmutation. I was introduced to my colleagues, my equals as the Master called them. 

First was Bob the Blob, an abominably large slab of meat with the heart of a little child. He was my favorite to work with, as he would always diffuse a tough situation with humor. Ever working, never failing. 

Then was Carila. The beloved lady of our league, whom we very much took great care even though she was quite eccentric. She behaved like a well-mannered lady of immense beauty, even though she was hideous to look upon, even for my own standards. She was thin like a fishing rod with bones protruding and stretching her dry flesh. She had more appendages than all others combined which she used for making her potions and salves. 

Our expert crafters, Pong and Tong and Kong or as we used to call them the Krell brothers, worked in unison creating items of wonder and power. They combined ingenuity in alchemy and magic. Where one would brainstorm a terrific idea, the remaining 2 would take it to the next level. 

Last but not least, was Clyve. Clyve is my best friend and also my first creation. He is a tiny genius, a pocket menace, a mechanical scoundrel and a technological devil. A powerstone rests at his core from which I blew life into him. He is the size of a walnut with 4 tiny wiry arms for deep cuts and engineering and also 4 legs that end on powerful claws for grabbing. 

This was us, in our marvelous laboratory, where the Master visited us daily. We were sure to know that we were as much assistants as experiments. This rushing realization came to me the day Master ripped off my right arm, shoulder height. I woke up 3 days later with Carila above me cleaning the stitched scab. When I inquired the Master on why he removed my most powerful tool, my good hand, he simply told me that I needed to grow and evolve. Enraged, I did the unthinkable and turned against him but he was a quickdraw. Took me out before I knew. He then took my left eye and told me that I lacked vision. From then on, I cursed his name as much as I Sanctified it. 

The years that followed had us prepare for the Grand Conjuration as Master called it. He never cared to explain what it was. A mysterious group of men kept visiting the lab weekly but we were not privy to their conversations. I took liberty and every time we were not supervised, I worked with Clyve to make a replacement arm, a mechanical monstrosity to replace my lost limb. Day after day, I made some good progress and affixed unto me. It took time to adjust but Bob was there for me to help me up when I stumbled and pick up my mess when I fumbled. This along with the help of Clyve and the other kickstarted the fires of invention inside me. For the first time I desired to create for me, not for Master or anyone else. I made attachments for the arm and ports in order for it to be compatible with future projects. The day the Grand Conjuration would approach and I would be ready to make my move. I would then start making a replacement for my eye, but that all changed. 

One terrible day, fire erupted. Explosions shook the place. Men where shouting outside, Master was nowhere to be seen. We were helpless. The lab exploded as I took Clyve under my hood and run, picking up bibs and gadgets around. I made a sprint through the cracks and only when I made the distance I looked back. This was a disaster. And the lab wasn’t that, ‘twas a castle. A terrible Fortress of some sorts. With no sign of the others, I run and I run. Hot burning discs on the sky became cold revealing crescents. 

On the 3rd day I stumbled upon a bloody mess. It was Carila’s cadaver, broken and bisected. For the first time since I knew her, she had a calm and relaxed face, almost beautiful. I said my goodbyes, grabbed her long cloak and kept running. 

On the 4th day I found a derelict house. Inside I found dead bodies that looked like me. I robbed them of their belongings, dressed up and moved on. And that was life for a long while. Scavenging, grave-robbing, stealing. Never heard from Bob or the Krells. Clyve was my only friend. 

On the cities and towns I visited, I took upon jobs of craftsmanship and hardware. I seemed to always have the right tool for the job. What payment I got I required for it to be either sustenance of the food variety or spare parts, screws and bolts. Hand needed repairs and upgrades. But then I Had to upgrade the power-core, adjust the arm-blade, calibrate the energy propulsion vents and…. Yeah sorry got carried away with the details. Anyway, my everburning desire to understand this world that I happened upon and also fulfill my self-improvement, or rather self-upgrade, I invited Clyve out of my clothing to see the big city spreading on the edge of the Horizon….." Could you point out major plot hooks and what we could do with them?



- Ποια ηταν η μεγαλυτερη αποφαση ή καμπη της ζωης του χαρακτήρα σου; Αν επαιρνε μια διαφορετικη αποφαση, πως θα ηταν διαφορετικη ζωη του; Πως θα ηταν διαφορετικη η ζωη του αν εκανε επιλογες με βαση τις προσδοκιες των αλλων;
	- H αποφαση να το σκασει απο το καστρο στην πρωτη ευκαιρια. Ουτε που εμαθε τι συνεβη, ουτε πως ωρηκε το θαρρος. Ηταν ενστικτο της στιγμης. Αν δεν το ειχε κανει ισως να ειχε πεθανει, ισως να ειχε καταληξει δουλος σε ακομη χειροτερο αφεντη


- Ποιο ειναι κατι που ο χαρακτηρας σου ευχεται να μπορουσε να αλλαξει στον εαυτο του; Πως θα ηταν διαφορετικη η καλυτερη αυτη εκδοχη του εαυτου του; (Μπορει να μην υπαρχει και καλυτερη φυσικα)
	- Γενικα, τις αναπηριες του. Τις σιχενεται βαθια, καθως πιστευει οτι τον κανουν "λιγοτερο". Ευχεται να ηταν σαν τους αλλους καποιες φορες.


- Ποιο ειναι το χαρακτηριστικο ή το φυσικο χαρακτηριστικο του χαρακτηρα σου το οποιο θα εμενε αναλλοιωτο, ανεξαρτητα απο το τι θα μπορουσε να ειχε συμβει στη ζωη του; (Αν αυτο υπαρχει)
	- Για να ειμαι ειλικρινης, τιποτα. Θεωρει την υπαρξη του ενα unlikely chance. Δεν θα επρεπε να ζει, θεωρει. Επομενως ειναι τοσο random που θεωρει πως τιποτα μεμονωμενα δεν ειναι τοσο αναλλοιωτο
