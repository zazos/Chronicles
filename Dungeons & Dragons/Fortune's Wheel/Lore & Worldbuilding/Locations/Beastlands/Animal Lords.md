*The **Animal Lords** are quasi-powers in their own right; and on the **Beastlands**, they are virtually invincible. Of course, like so many other creatures in the Planescape setting, the Animal Lords are not meant to be enemies for the PCs to slash their way through in order to gain treasure. Rather, they are primal forces for the characters to meet and encounter in their quests on the Beastlands, as the Animal Lords as possibly the most prominent and powerful beings on that Plane. However, on the Beastlands, the Animal Lords are referred to as the **seyhrain**, or “beast lords” in the animal-speak of the Beastlands. However, for the sake of convenience and familiarity, the term “Animal Lord” will be used frequently to refer to the **seyhrain**.*
