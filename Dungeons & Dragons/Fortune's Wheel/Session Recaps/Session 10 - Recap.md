- introduced eerie familiarity with Josbert
- he was going to refuge them in some place in the Lower Ward to be safe from Harmonium for the time being
- the encounter in the canals exploded, the spirits transformed into a [[Spectral Beholder]]
- Josbert mentioned making some short of offering or a respectful rite to calm the spirits.
- Zill performed the speak with the dead musically and the beholder fixed its gaze on him, demanding to bring it it's family's crest down in the waters.
- Nibi and Rubicon swum downwards. The mausoleum that was drowned beneath the undersigil contained 2 portals to some Shar-related planes of existence.
- Also Nibi found the signet wrapped around an algae, which caused Nibi to see visions of Lord Enveris' past and the demise of the family that was buried in this mausoleum.
- Lord Enveris (the beholder itself) focused his eye and destroyed the ring, freeing themselves from Shar's curse. 
- From the ring's destruction, the splash of necrotic energy nearly killed Zill.
- The explosion made him unconscious, finding himself in the Fugue Plane
- There he met Bhaal. He demanded blood and murder. He didn't appreciate that the gang prevented Shadowknave's journey to Bhaal's domain. 
- Finally, they managed to reach the old safehouse, where they made a short rest.

Note to Self:  Zill died and encounter Bhaal. During the next long rest a helping hand should appear, someone that can severe this persistent affliction that had been cast on Zill, from back when he searched for revenge of his fathers. This saviour should be decided! Someone opposing Bhaal.
