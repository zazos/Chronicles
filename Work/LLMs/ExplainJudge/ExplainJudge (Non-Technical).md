This pipeline transforms complex AI decision-making into transparent and trustworthy insights through three integrated components.
1. **Explainability Analysis:** The system identifies key factors driving AI predictions using established interpretability techniques. For example, in a diabetes risk model, it may detect that blood glucose levels and BMI are primary predictors (feature-importance analysis). 
2. **Narrative Translation:** A large language model (**NarratorLLM**) converts the technical insights into accessible narratives tailored to end-users, of the specific use-case. Following on the previous example, the Narrator may recommend consultation with an endocrinologist within 2 weeks if it judges that some values indicate strong diabetes risk, based on the numerical input from the explainability analysis.
3. **Quality Validation:** Another large language model (**JudgeLLM**), takes the generated narratives and passes them into a rigorous assessment against critical pillars, such as *contextual accuracy* (alignment with use-case guidelines), *operation safety* (ensuring narration avoids harmful misinterpretations) and *actionability* (confirming clear use-case specific next steps).

This framework bridges AI complexity with human understanding while maintaining rigorous quality standards for sensitive domains like healthcare.
