[Shemeshka's Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVAp5UDnsPI&list=RDoVAp5UDnsPI&start_radio=1)

Shemeshka is a cunning, manipulative, and extraordinarily influential Arcanaloth residing in Sigil, known as the "Queen of the Crosstrade." She operates primarily from her decadent casino and den of intrigue, **Fortune's Wheel**, a nexus for plots, schemes, and secrets of planar magnitude. Her true power lies in her information networks and political maneuvering rather than overt force.

**Portfolio and Influence:**

- **Broker of Secrets:**  
    Shemeshka specializes in gathering, trading, and leveraging secrets across the multiverse. No whisper in Sigil goes unheard by her ears, and no information is beyond her grasp, making her feared and respected.
- **Manipulator Extraordinaire:**  
    Shemeshka’s schemes often involve intricate manipulation of planar factions, adventurers, and even powerful cosmic entities. She engineers conflicts to maintain chaos, ensuring profitable outcomes for herself.
- **Owner of Fortune's Wheel:**  
    Fortune's Wheel isn't just a casino—it's an embassy of influence. Within its gilded halls, negotiations, blackmail, espionage, and plots unfold nightly, with Shemeshka subtly directing the course of planar affairs.

### **Personality and Traits:**

- **Charismatic yet Sinister:**  
    Shemeshka exudes an alluring charm, always impeccably dressed in elaborate finery, displaying grace and a veneer of friendliness masking ruthless ambition.
- **Paranoid and Calculating:**  
    Always anticipating betrayal, Shemeshka keeps contingencies layered upon contingencies. No interaction is accidental; every meeting, conversation, or invitation serves multiple hidden purposes.
- **Egotistical and Vain:**  
    Shemeshka revels in displays of wealth, power, and her own superiority. Compliments and displays of respect can open doors, though flattery must be careful, as she quickly tires of obsequiousness.

### **Roleplaying Shemeshka:**

**Voice, Demeanor & Mannerisms:**

- **Voice:** Soft, measured, never rushed—like someone who already knows the conclusion. When she speaks, phrases are clipped to highlight the important words: “I can provide **indeed**, but at a **price**.”
- **Smile:** Always present, never quite reaching her eyes. The corners of her lips lift just enough to suggest amusement at a private joke.
- **Eyes:** Razor-sharp. She sizes up every detail—posture, microexpressions, even the way a coin clinks on a marble table.
- **Posture:** Graceful and upright; though she never rushes, her movement is precise—like a chessmaster adjusting pieces, never making a misstep.

**Speech Patterns & Dialogue Traits:**

- **Polite Formality with Underlying Edge:**
    - “I trust you understand my position… yes?”
    - “Such a pity you lack the proper… annals to prove otherwise.”
- **Veiled Threats & Double Meanings:**
    - “The tapestry of fate is… delicate. One pulls too hard on a thread, and the whole thing unravels.”
    - “Should you betray me, my dear, I will see to it that you learn precisely how fragile reality can be.”

**Handling Betrayal & Conflict:**

- **Never Yell, Always Whisper:**
    - When angered, her voice drops to a whisper that still echoes with magic, causing fabrics to ripple around her.
- **Use Magic Sparingly but Devastatingly:**
    - She carries a pair of arcane daggers etched with planar runes. One stab disrupts teleportation circles; another severs wards. She won’t use them lightly—just enough to remind you she can.



### Motivations & Long-Term Goals

- **Primary Objective:**
    - **Monopolize Planar Conflict Profits.** By engineering wars or rumors (especially between Mechanus and Limbo), she ensures that reconstruction contracts, salvage rights, and postwar salvage fall into her hands.

- **Secondary Interests:**
    - **Collect Rare Artifacts of “Reality.”** She is obsessed with items rumored to stabilize—or destabilize—planar boundaries (e.g., a broken cog from a modron Prime, a shard of the Lady of Pain’s mask).
    - **Expand Her Demiplanar Archives.** Every new fragment of forbidden lore feeds her insatiable appetite for dominion over knowledge.
    - **Maintain Political Balance in Sigil.** She cultivates rivals just enough to keep each other in check, so no single faction eliminates her as a middleman.

- **Personal Driving Force:**
    - She genuinely believes that “information is fate.” If she can control the story (who knows what and when), she can control the outcomes of wars, the destinies of gods, and the careers of once-mortal heroes.
