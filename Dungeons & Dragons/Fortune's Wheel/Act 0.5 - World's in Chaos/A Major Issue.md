*Location: Market Ward*

As the characters peruse the shops in the Market Ward, they hear some interesting information about the gate-town Rigus and its current troubles.

*The crowd of people within the massive market square you find yourselves in parts like a wave as a group of lightly armored individuals march into the center of the area. The group consists of all manner of humanoids; hobgoblins and humans, dwarves and ogres. Each of them have shimmering rank insignias pinned to their chests. The command to halt is given and the member of their group leading it steps out to the side and stands before them, a hobgoblin female with her legs akimbo and hands clasped at her back. "For some of you, this is your first shore leave. I don't have to remind you, this is a privilege. We'll be returning to Rigus in 24 hours. Should you fail to return at the appointed time, you and your battle buddy will be court-martialed. DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?"*  
*The group responds back as one forceful bark, "Ma'am, yes ma'am!"*  
*The leader dismisses the group and they disperse.*

The hobgoblin is [[Nirra Kalar.webp||Major Nirra Kalar]] (See Chapter 10). She is escorting a regiment of troops from Rigus on shore leave to Sigil. It's a relatively common affair, and there is a portal from Rigus in the Market Ward. It is a wide archway shaped like a tower shield. The key to using it is a crisp military salute or a day pass signed by one of the generals of Rigus. It leads to the second ring of the gate-town.

**Major Kalar.** The hobgoblin goes about her shopping, a sly smile of excitement on her face as she peruses the weapons on display in a nearby stall. As the characters pass by, she takes note of them, recognising one of them as a member of her regiment that she believes to have died.

*The hobgoblin woman turns and does a double-take at your party and immediately starts to stride toward you. "So this is where you've been hiding for all these years?"*

**Mistaken Identities?** Major Kalar believes these characters to be dead, and even attended their Final Procession (See Chapter 3 of Sigil and the Outlands), though no bodies were ever recovered. Characters can attempt to convince Major Kalar of the mistake, or explain their situation with a DC 12 Charisma (Perusasion) check. Characters who have seen duplicates of themselves or have died and have new bodies have advantage on this check.

On a success she mutters something about being tired from all the fighting in Rigus, relating the following:

- Rigus has been under assault from Acheron for months now.
    
- She's here looking for weapons that might give her people a tactical advantage as their usual arms dealer, Fetchtatter has been absent.
    
- The gate to Acheron is closed until further notice, but has been opening unexpectedly. This constant state of war will tip the gate-town into Acheron if it continues.
    

On a failure, she threatens the characters with courts martial should they ever return to Rigus and will ensure their names are stricken from the Final Procession and leaves in a huff. If Parisa is with the party, she can provide the characters with the first and third points as rumours have swirled around regarding the fate of Rigus.
