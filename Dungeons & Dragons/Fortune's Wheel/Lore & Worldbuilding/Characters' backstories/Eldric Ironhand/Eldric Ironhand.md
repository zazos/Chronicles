Eldric Ironhand: The Forgeborn of the Abyssal Time

In the heart of the Underdark, nestled within the luminescent crystal caverns of Phaervorul, the Ironhand family legacy had thrived for generations. Esteemed blacksmiths, they melded arcane arts with their craft, working with rare ores that resonated with a curious temporal energy. This gift drew the attention of many, seduced by the ores' power and beauty.
Eldric, the latest prodigy of the Ironhand lineage, was especially skilled. His creations were alive, singing with an energy that seemed to tug at the very threads of time. 
Centuries before Eldric's birth, his ancestor, Thalor Ironhand, made a pact with a powerful and ancient entity from the Abyss known as Zel'noth the Time Devourer. Thalor, desperate to save his dying wife, sought the power to manipulate time. In exchange for this power, Zel'noth demanded a price: every third generation, the eldest Ironhand would unknowingly serve as a conduit for Zel'noth's influence, slowly siphoning their life force and enabling the creature to step into the Material Plane.
As it happens, Eldric is the latest in line, the chosen vessel. The temporal resonance in the ores the Ironhands worked with wasn't just an anomaly—it was a manifestation of Zel'noth's lingering essence. While Eldric believes his invention might control time, its true purpose, unbeknownst to him, is to serve as the final anchor for Zel'noth's complete transition to their world.
The district where the Ironhand family lived was struck by a mysterious and malevolent force. One fateful evening, as Eldric played outside, the very shadows around the Ironhand forge began to writhe and twist, taking on a life of their own. They coalesced into a dark vortex, a swirling abyss from which echoed whispers of ancient, forgotten tongues. 
As the vortex grew, it consumed everything in its path — buildings, tools, and tragically, Eldric's parents. They tried to shield their son, pushing him out of the way, but were ensnared by the inky tendrils and pulled into the abyss, leaving no trace behind. 
The event lasted only minutes, but its effects were devastating. When it ended, the vortex simply vanished, leaving behind a district in ruins and a young Eldric, traumatized and orphaned. The phenomenon became known as "The Shadow's Maw" among the Underdark residents. Many speculated about its origins and purpose, but none could provide answers.
Rescued from the remnants of his past by Gallan, a Deep Gnome with his own enigmatic history, Eldric delved deeper into the arcane mysteries of the Underdark. This mentorship unveiled forgotten lore, hinting at ancient civilizations once ruling these cavernous depths.One day, Gallan shared a deep secret: a blueprint for a device that could manipulate time itself. But creating such a device would require rare materials, many of which were deemed myths.
Driven by a desire to prevent the tragedy that befell his family, Eldric embarked on a quest to gather these materials, he relied on his skills to craft equipment and defensive mechanisms to survive. Despite the challenges, the memories of his family and Gallan's teachings kept him determined
After months of searching, Eldric finally locates one of the component needed for his time-altering device, a gem rumored to hold the very essence of time within its crystalline lattice. As he is about to claim it from the depths of a forgotten temple, he is ambushed by a cloaked figure. A fierce battle ensues, and just as Eldric feels he's gaining the upper hand, the stranger halts the fight with a plea.
Removing her hood, the figure reveals herself as Elara, Eldric's younger sister, whom he believed perished  alongside their parents. Shocked and filled with emotion, Eldric listens as Elara unfolds a story of her own survival. On that fateful night, a mysterious benefactor saved her taking her to a distant land and training her in the arcane arts. The reason? To stop Eldric from completing the time-altering device.
Elara reveals that their benefactor hails from a bleak future, a world torn asunder by the misuse of the very device Eldric seeks to create. Its existence, she claims, would lead to endless war and the rise of a dark abyssal lord (Zelnoth), with factions vying to control and manipulate time for their own gain. Their parents' death, she sorrowfully explains, was an indirect result of the device's creation, a ripple in time caused by its very existence.
Faced with this revelation, Eldric is torn. He's driven by the desire to change the past, to save his parents, but now he knows the devastating consequences of his ambition.
But the dark lord wouldn't let fate and chance drive the threads of time
Moros, an exiled mage transformed by the Underdark's essence, stalked Eldric's progress. The Underdark's treacherous passages concealed many secrets. Among them was the Order of the Shattered Hourglass, obsessed with the promise of controlling time.Moros as the leader of the order saw potential in Eldric.The exiled mage saw Eldric's device as his ticket to ascendancy, or more so the ascendancy of Zeln'oth as it is revealed that the order is his pawn .
Bound by ambition, duty, and the haunting memories of a tragic past, Eldric Ironhand's odyssey unraveled. It was a journey of introspection, impending doom, and the inexorable flow of time, all overshadowed by the encroaching Abyss
