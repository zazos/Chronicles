### **Level 5: “Bibbl the Whisper-Tongue”**

- **Form**: Still an imp, but eyes now glow crimson and his whisper causes paranoia in mortals.
    
- **New Power – Infernal Whispers (1/short rest)**: Bibbl can cast _Dissonant Whispers_ as a 2nd-level spell (DC = Orianna’s spell DC). When cast, only the target hears the voice, and it sounds like Orianna’s.
    
- **Enhancement**: Can turn invisible as a bonus action (instead of action), once per short rest.

### **Level 9: “Bibbl the Skin-Thief”**

- **Form**: Skin becomes stretched tight, almost translucent; he begins to mock the forms of others.
    
- **New Power – Fleshmask**: Bibbl can cast _Disguise Self_ at will, mimicking voices perfectly (Deception advantage).
    
- **New Action – Soul Brand**: Once per long rest, Bibbl can mark a creature within 5 feet. Orianna has advantage on spell attacks against the branded target for 1 minute.
    
- **Bonded Enhancement**: Orianna can now cast _Misty Step_ once per short rest by briefly swapping places with Bibbl, who then appears in her original location.

### **Level 13: “Bibbl the Blightfiend”**

- **Form**: Grows in size (Small), four wings (two skeletal, two bat-like), and oozes shadow from his claws.
    
- **New Power – Infernal Hexfire (1/day)**: Bibbl channels Valyndra’s brand, casting _Bestow Curse_ or _Shadow of Moil_ once per long rest.
    
- **Hellish Transfusion**: Bibbl can take 10 damage to give Orianna 1 expended spell slot (once per long rest). The effect comes with visible pain and blood-smoking from his eyes.

### **Level 17: “Bibbl the Writ-Bound”**

- **Form**: Now fully a unique fiend (custom statblock), covered in infernal runes. A halo of embers floats above him.
    
- **New Power – Pact Anchor**: Orianna’s concentration cannot be broken on spells as long as Bibbl is within 30 feet and conscious.
    
- **Commanding Form**: Bibbl can cast _Dominate Person_ once per long rest. When used on a fiend, the DC is made with disadvantage.
    
- **Legendary Action (1/turn)**: If Orianna drops to 0 HP, Bibbl may immediately fly to her and cast _Revify Soul_ – she returns to 1 HP, and Bibbl is banished to the Nine Hells for 24 hours.
