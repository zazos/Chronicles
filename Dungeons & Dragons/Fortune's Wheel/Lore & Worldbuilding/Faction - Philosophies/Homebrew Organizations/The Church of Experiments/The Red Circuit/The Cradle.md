# The Cradle - A scattered Haven of Anarchy

Beneath the streets of the Cage lies a myriad of tunnels and passageways, long-forgotten alleys that have been built on top of, the cellars of buildings that collapsed and were built upon and forgotten, sewers, tombs, dungeons, secret ways and catacombs. Outcasts and ancient evils both call this place home. Cutters who can’t—or won’t—fit into the Hive find their way into these dark recesses and make their kip.

The Cradle exists as a series of clandestine ripperdoc shops, covert taverns, ramshackle warehouses, and repurposed residential spaces, forming an anarchic, decentralized network entirely controlled by the Red Circuit.

### The Hidden Network

- **Ripperdoc Shops (Meatshops):** These grisly establishments are hidden in the shadows of dilapidated buildings and industrial ruins. Operated by Scorchers, they’re easily identifiable by flickering neon signs, grimy exteriors, and the metallic scent of blood and machinery emanating from within.

- **Shadow Taverns:** A couple of illicit taverns like the "Circuit Breaker" and the "Black Diode" serve as the nexus for information exchange, recruitment, and clandestine dealings. They’re cloaked behind mundane storefronts or accessed through hidden alleyways. The interiors are dimly lit, punctuated by the eerie glow of augmented patrons.

- **Abandoned Warehouses:** Scattered across the Cradle’s territory, warehouses store stolen tech, salvaged equipment, and experimental prototypes smuggled from the Church. These warehouses, often rigged with booby-traps and alarm systems, also serve as temporary bases or emergency hideouts.


### Living Amidst the Ruins

- **Residences:** Members of the Red Circuit who choose to reside within the Cradle occupy forgotten tenements, condemned apartment complexes, and subterranean bunkers reclaimed from the undercity's decay. These are makeshift homes—fortified with salvaged metal, reinforced by stolen magitech.

#### The Cradle's Aesthetic

- A fusion of arcane magitech, cybernetic decay, and brutalist machinery, reminiscent of Zaun from Arcane and Cyberpunk 2077’s grittiest back-alley clinics.
- A network of interconnected tunnels, repurposed warforged chassis, and neon-lit sanctuaries of stolen knowledge.

#### Security & Constant Threats

- The Harmonium relentlessly hunts the Red Circuit, launching frequent raids into Undersigil. The Cradle is not a permanent safe haven, forcing the Pact to relocate every few months when the heat gets too strong.
- The Cradle is lined with hacked modrons, glitched constructs, and booby-trapped corridors, ensuring that unwanted guests meet a swift and violent end.

#### Escape & Smuggling Routes

- The Red Circuit relies on a network of secret pathways to stay mobile, using sewers, abandoned train tunnels, planar rifts, and forgotten portals to smuggle cyberware, evade capture, and relocate when needed.
- Some gateways lead into realms even the Church fears to explore, fueling rumors that the Red Circuit has discovered lost pre-Modron technology.

### Life and Population

- **Limited Numbers:** The Red Circuit’s population within the Cradle rarely exceeds a hundred individuals. This small but ruthless population ensures secrecy, agility, and adaptability.
