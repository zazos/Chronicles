Rubicon, in a deep trance, finds himself in the heart of a mystical forest. The moon casts an ethereal glow over the surroundings, and the night is alive with the sounds of creatures. He feels a deep connection to the wild and the shapeshifting magic that defines his Circle.

As he explores the forest, his transformations become erratic and uncontrollable. He shifts between forms rapidly, from a wolf to a bear to an eagle, unable to maintain control. The forest around him reacts to this imbalance. Trees warp and twist, and the animals flee in confusion.

Rubicon's surroundings grow distorted. The moon in the sky becomes a maddening swirl of silver and black, reflecting his inner turmoil.

In the midst of this chaos, two spirits appear before him. One is a radiant spirit in the form of a wise and ancient moonlit white wolf. The other is a dark and imposing wolf with crimson inlays. The two spirits circle each other, representing opposing forces.

White Wolf: "Rubicon, your connection to the beasts is a sacred bond, a reflection of the moon's grace. But with great power comes great responsibility. You must find harmony within your transformations."

Red Wolf: "Embrace your animalistic nature! Tear through the food chain, become the apex, the alpha! Power is yours for the taking!"

Rubicon continues to shift between forms, caught between the influence of these two opposing spirits. The forest descends further into chaos.

White Wolf: "The moon's magic is yours to command, but it should not command you. The essence of the beasts is a gift, and you must learn to channel it with reverence."

Red Wolf: "The wild belongs to those who seize it! Tear through the natural order and dominate!"

The moon above continues to spin wildly, casting surreal shadows and echoing the disarray within Rubicon.

White Wolf: "To be a true master of the wild, you must understand that your transformations should reflect the balance of nature, not disrupt it. Embrace the stillness and unity within the dance of predator and prey."

Red Wolf: "The wild respects only the strongest. Be the apex predator!"

As the forest spirals further into chaos, Rubicon experiences a sense of guilt and sorrow. The moonlit white wolf's form begins to fade, while the red wolf's presence grows stronger.

White Wolf: "Remember, Rubicon, you are the Moon's guardian. Learn to wield the moonlit magic with respect."

Red Wolf: "Embrace your nature and seize power!"
