*Who Bring Justice to the Deserving*

![[FactionMercykillers5e.webp | 300]]

**Factol**: Alisohn Nilesia

**Headquarters**: Prison

**Aligned Plane**: Acheron

**Members**: Bounty hunters, executioners, vigilantes

**Epithet**: Jailers, Red Death

The Mercykillers believe that cold, relentless justice is absolute and that no one is above it. To the Jailers, a perfect multiverse is one purged of injustice.

Mercykillers earned their name for their ruthlessness. They’ve killed their own mercy, viewing it as an exploitable weakness. Criminals may beg as they please, but their sentences are carried out with unshakable fervor.

Jailers don’t make laws or pass judgment. Similarly, they don’t arrest lawbreakers—that’s the Harmonium’s job. Mercykillers act only after a verdict has been made, administering punishment without leniency. Members believe they answer to a higher cosmic law that absolves them of any wrongdoing during their unabating pursuit of justice.

Factol Alisohn Nilesia (lawful evil, tiefling mage), a young and cunning leader raised in Sigil’s penitentiary, was born to head the Mercykillers. She’s a strict warden, using divination magic to track down fugitives and deploy agents to retrieve them. Somehow, she finds time to personally sign off on every punishment in the Cage. Mercykillers whisper that justice never sleeps, and neither does Nilesia.

**Faction Attire**. Mercykillers are the picture of vengeance. Manacles rattle against their bladed armor, and masks or hoods obscure their expressions, ensuring the face of justice is detached from its duty.

**Role in Sigil**. The Mercykillers headquarter in the Prison, an imposing gray fortress that holds criminals sentenced by the courts of Sigil. Non-Mercykillers can gain entry under certain circumstances, such as to present evidence that might exonerate an inmate or visit a low-risk prisoner. Jailers clash with factions that elevate individual freedom, most notably the Hands of Havoc, Mind’s Eye, and Society of Sensation.

## To Err is Human, to Punish is Divine

The Red Death are one of the most feared factions of the Cage. Seeing as they’re the bashers who lock up cross traders and hang stag turners from the leafless tree, a body oughtn’t be too surprised at that. Nothing about the faction is more grim than their headquarters, however. They make their lair in Sigil’s Prison, and a more foreboding structure you never will find. Even the weather there seems less forgiving than elsewhere in the city; almost as if it’s punishing the faction itself.

As a rule, the Mercykillers are a secretive faction. That mightn’t even be intentional though, berk; it’s just that its members are so sodding unapproachable. Perhaps it’s their somewhat hypocritical philosophy that rubs bashers up the wrong way: All crime should be punished, unless you’re a Mercykiller. See, laws that get broken in the pursuit of catching a criminal don’t count. A cynic would say that so long as a Mercykiller factioneer can come up with a plausible excuse, he could get away, quite literally, with murder.

I’d be careful around ’em if I were you…
