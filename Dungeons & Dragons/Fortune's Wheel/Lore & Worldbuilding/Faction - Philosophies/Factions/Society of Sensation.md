*Who Find Truth Only in Experience*

![[FactionSocietyofSensation5e.webp | 300]]

Factol: Erin Darkflame Montgomery

Headquarters: Civic Festhall

**Aligned Plane**: Arborea

**Members**: Artists, entertainers, revelers

**Epithet**: Sensates

The Society of Sensation perceives the multiverse through experiences—the more varied, the better. By experiencing all there is—every sensation, emotion, thought, everything—one can learn and understand the entirety of existence.

Sensates live each moment as if it were the only one that ever mattered, drinking it in to know another sliver of reality. Many Sensates, particularly new members, focus only on experiences that delight the senses, but as Sensates grow, they aim to experience every facet of existence, even the bad ones.

Sweet fragrances and savory bites must be balanced with the sting of failure, the weight of responsibility, and the gnawing ache of grief.

The Society of Sensation pays a price for its lack of inhibition. Outsiders view Sensates as flighty, lascivious, or untrustworthy, always jumping from one event to the next. For a Sensate, to dwell on one endeavor is to deny the truth of existence.

Factol Erin Darkflame Montgomery (lawful good, human Society of Sensation Muse) guides the society through every lingering exploration. Factol Montgomery ensures that Sensates maintain a balance of cerebral pursuits, physical experiences, and deliberate contemplation, knowing the harm that pleasure-seeking alone can cause.

**Faction Attire**. Sensates garb themselves in flowing, colorful fashions that emphasize their free-spirited natures. Floral elements and glasswork embellishments are common.

**Role in Sigil**. The Society of Sensation provides joy and diversion to the people of Sigil, temporarily freeing them from the everyday struggles of the Cage. Sensates and members of the Mind’s Eye find common ground. Factol Montgomery’s rivalry with Duke Rowan Darkwood of the Fated sparks trouble between the two factions.

## Watch Me, Hear Me, Smell Me, Touch Me, Taste Me ... Know Me

A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, as they say. To a Sensate, it’s worth four. See, the members of the Society of Sensation believe that there’s nothing so important as experiencing things. You can never really be sure if something’s true until you see it for yourself, they reckon. So it’s hardly surprising then that the Sensates are some of the best planewalkers, most daring adventurers, and passionate cutters you’ll find this side of **Arborea**. They’re also frequently temperamental, rarely sober, and fiendishly difficult to surprise.

Better pity the basher who’s married to a Sensate. It might be hard to by gifts for some folk, but try finding a veteran Sensate a gift they ain’t already bored with is as hard as trying to persuade a **yugoloth** to give the sweets that he’s not yet got round to poisoning to a bunch of children. Fickle? You don’t know the half of it…
