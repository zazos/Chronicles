## Roleplay Notes

**Cover Identity:** Professor Aldric Stonetext, historical researcher
**Personality:** Quietly intellectual, methodical, ruthlessly efficient
**Mannerisms:** Adjusts spectacles, takes detailed notes, speaks softly
**Voice:** Measured academic tone hiding cold calculation

### Key Dialogue
> "Fascinating architectural details in this car. The structural stress points are quite... illuminating."
>
> "History teaches us that sometimes problems simply... disappear."

## Combat Tactics

**Preferred Strategy:** Environmental kills and "accidents"
**Opening Round:** Activates *stoneskin* or *greater invisibility*
**Crowd Control:** Uses train environment as weapons
**Elimination Focus:** Prioritizes witnesses and evidence

**Signature Moves:**
- Steam pipe "accidents" (Environmental Kill)
- Poisoned academic implements  
- Mechanical "malfunctions" causing falls or crushing

## Equipment (Disguised)

**Academic Gear:**
- Leather satchel (contains poison supplies)
- Historical texts (hollow books with weapons)
- Wire-rim spectacles (enhanced with darkvision)
- Walking cane (disguised warhammer)
- Scholarly robes (actually magical plate armor)
- Research notes (coded mission instructions)

**Hidden Arsenal:**
- Poison needles (in pens and quills)
- Alchemical supplies (research chemicals)
- Lock picks (precision instruments)
- Smoke bombs (chemical experiments)
- Emergency teleportation scroll (historical document)

## Mission Specialization

**Primary Role:** Elimination specialist and final contingency
**Secondary Role:** Environmental manipulation and area denial
**Emergency Protocol:** If capture fails, eliminate all witnesses including The Stranger

**Professional Standards:**
- Prefers "accidental" deaths
- Minimizes direct combat when possible
- Always has three escape routes planned
- Documents nothing that could trace back to Shemeshka
