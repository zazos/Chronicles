# Concordant Express - Train Layout and NPC Locations

![Concordant Express Map](../Images%20dump/Concordant_Express_Map_Annotated.webp)

*The Concordant Express travels the Great Road across the Outlands, a marvel of planar engineering connecting distant gate-towns to Automata.*

---

## Train Overview

**Total Length:** 9 cars (E1-E9)  
**Direction of Travel:** East toward Automata  
**Journey Time:** 8 hours  
**Security Level:** High (prisoner transport)

### Car Numbering System
Cars are numbered E1-E9 from **rear to front**, with E1 being the caboose and E9 the engine car.

---

## Car-by-Car Layout

### E1 - Caboose Car
**Function:** Observation and rear security

*This classic caboose features wide windows offering panoramic views of the passing landscape. A small observation deck with safety railings extends from the rear, while emergency equipment hangs neatly from wall brackets. A communication console crackles softly with occasional status reports from the engine car.*

**NPCs Located Here:**
- **Emergency Extraction Point** for Adia's agents
- **Brass "Lucky" Cogsworth** (occasional maintenance visits)

---

### E2 - Abacus Car
**Function:** Administrative and record-keeping

*Rows of mechanical calculating devices click and whir throughout this orderly car. Filing cabinets line the walls, their drawers labeled in multiple languages. Clerks in neat uniforms work diligently at wooden desks, updating passenger manifests and transport documentation with precise efficiency. The steady rhythm of abacus beads creates an almost hypnotic soundtrack.*

**NPCs Located Here:**
- **Harmonium Clerk** (manages passenger records)
- **Administrative Staff** (2-3 officials)
- **Ignatius Inkblot** (occasional research visits)

---

### E3 - Aquarium Car
**Function:** Host aquatic creatures that travel to aquatic planes

*This car is filled with clear water that isn't displaced when the door opens. The car's interior space is a large aquarium, complete with a coral reef and algae-coated ruins. Tiny fish dart through the ruins and circle an alabaster statue carved in the likeness of an angel clutching a decanter. Nearby fish scatter at the sight of you.*

This car is completely flooded, and magic keeps the water from being displaced when either door is opened. Creatures that can't breathe underwater must hold their breath in the aquarium. Magic instantly dries creatures as they exit the water.

The alabaster statue is a petrified deva with a decanter of endless water. If any harm befalls the fish in the aquarium, the deva immediately reverts to flesh and chastises whoever is responsible.

---

### E4 - Cargo Car
**Function:** Freight and supplies storage

*Wooden crates and canvas-wrapped bundles fill this utilitarian car from floor to ceiling. Passenger trunks and suitcases are secured in neat rows along one wall, while maintenance equipment hangs from hooks and brackets. The air carries the mingled scents of leather, oil, and various exotic goods. Narrow pathways wind between the cargo, creating a maze-like environment.*

**NPCs Located Here:**
- **Brass "Lucky" Cogsworth** (maintenance duties)
- **Cargo Handlers** (2 staff members)
- **Kess the Whisper** (conductor duties, checking manifests)

---

### E5 - Planetarium Car
**Function:** Entertainment and education  
**Description:** A circular car with a domed ceiling displaying magical constellations and planar alignments. The most prestigious passenger area.

*Glowing symbols on the floor line the perimeter of this domed car. In the middle of the car is a mechanical model suspended over a dais that has more glowing symbols on it. The model resembles a large wheel with a tall spire protruding from the top. A tiny brass ring floats above the spire's peak.*

*The spectral blue image of a modron materializes before the dais. It has a boxy shape and wears a pair of oversized glasses. The illusory modron adjusts its glasses and joyfully greets you in Common:*

*"Hello, and welcome to the Planartarium. You can learn more about the planes of existence by donating to this car. All proceeds benefit the establishment of order across the multiverse." Before disappearing, the modron gestures toward a short tube protruding from the floor near the dais.*

The sixteen glowing sigils on the floor represent each of the Outer Planes, while the raised dais in the center of the room bears symbols of the four elemental Inner Planes. The wheel-shaped model above the dais represents the Outlands and its sixteen gate-towns. The tiny ring at the top of the spire represents Sigil.

A magical mote of golden light denotes the train's location. Since the train's travels are usually limited to the Inner Planes, the Outer Planes, and the Outlands, this mote can be seen floating above one of the symbols or above the model wheel representing the Outlands. If the train is in some other location not represented in this car, no mote is visible.

The short tube rising from the floor near the dais has a slot large enough to insert coins, gemstones, and other small valuables. Such valuables are then teleported to the cart in area E9.

Whenever a creature drops at least 10 gp worth of treasure into the tube, Cosmo, the illusory modron, reappears. It thanks the donor and asks which plane of existence they'd like to learn about.

Cosmo can give a brief lecture on any plane of existence described in the Dungeon Master's Guide. If a character asks about a plane on the train's route, Cosmo also alludes to noteworthy planar effects. For example, if asked about the Nine Hells, the spectral duodrone might say, "Rest assured, the Concordant Express is reinforced to withstand extreme heat and extreme cold." Cosmo lectures about one plane per donation and vanishes after each lecture.

If a character inserts something worthless into the donation slot or otherwise tries to fool it with counterfeits and the like, the tube disgorges poisonous gas that quickly fills the compartment. This gas duplicates the effect of a stinking cloud spell that lasts for 1 minute or until it is dispersed.

**NPCs Located Here:**
- **Lady Seraphina Goldmere (Vex Maraleth)** - Luxury passenger suite
- **Wealthy passengers and nobles**
- **Planetarium Operator** (controls the magical displays)

### E6 - Passenger Car
**Function:** Standard passenger seating and services

*Comfortable bench seats upholstered in deep blue fabric line both sides of this car, with overhead luggage compartments and small personal reading lights. Private sleeping compartments occupy one end, their curtains drawn for privacy. A small service area offers basic refreshments, while washroom facilities provide necessary amenities. Passengers chat quietly or rest as the countryside rolls by through large windows.*

**NPCs Located Here:**
- **Engineer Cornelius Steamwright** (when not in engine car)
- **General passengers** (merchants, travelers, families)
- **Party members** (assigned seats in this car)
- **Thane Ironwhisper (Professor Stonetext)** (sleeper compartment)

---

### E7 - Temple Car
**Function:** Religious services and spiritual comfort  
**Description:** A multi-faith worship space with shrines to various deities. Provides spiritual services to passengers and crew.

*Stained-glass windows decorate the walls of this car, while its floors are adorned with exquisitely patterned rugs. Several columns support a vaulted mosaic ceiling. Kneeling before an altar is a serene priest in sunny robes.*

**NPCs Located Here:**
- **Sister Melody (Nyth the Silence)** - Traveling healer/cleric
- **Temple Attendant** (maintains shrines)
- **Pilgrims and devout passengers**

---

### E8 - Jail Car ‚≠ê **PRIMARY OBJECTIVE LOCATION**
**Function:** Prisoner transport and detention

*Heavy iron bars and reinforced walls give this car a fortress-like appearance. Four individual cells line one side, their doors bearing complex locking mechanisms. A central guard station provides clear sight lines to all cells, while weapon racks and security equipment line the opposite wall. The air hums faintly with magical wards, and the steady march of mechanical sentries echoes through the car.*

**Security Personnel:**
- **Captain Thaddeus Lawbringer (CR 9)** - Overall commander
- **Seraph Vigilance (CR 10)** - Divine guardian (activated if threatened)
- **2x Harmonium Sentinel Constructs (CR 4 each)** - Cell guards
- **2x Harmonium Sentinel Constructs (CR 4 each)** - Patrol guards
- **1x Harmonium Guardian Construct (CR 8)** - Emergency activation

**The Prisoner:**
- **Keth "The Stranger" Ravencrest (CR 12)** - Cell 3, dimensional shackles

---

### E9 - Engine Car
**Function:** Propulsion and primary systems  
**Description:** The heart of the train, containing the magical engines, primary controls, and essential systems.

*A massive furnace dominates the interior of this noisy car. Two spherical modrons shovel coins into the roaring fire while a brawny, nine-foot-tall automaton guards a treasure-filled fuel cart nearby. "Faster!" bellows a deep, disembodied voice.*

The sapient Engine Car is the source of the deep, booming voice. The car speaks Common and Modron. While it's moving and not talking, the Engine Car labors through an endless chain of short, forceful breaths timed with each rhythmic churn of its mechanisms. Its undercarriage chatters as dozens of mechanical arms lay railway tracks before the train.

Inside the car, two monodrones stoke the fire in the furnace by shoveling loot into it from a nearby cart. A shield guardian stands next to the cart, guarding the treasure from thieves. Thanks to its Spell Storing trait, the guardian can cast sleep (4th-level version) once.

**Furnace**
Any object not being worn or carried that is placed inside the blazing furnace is incinerated instantly. Even magic items succumb to the blazing furnace, though the flames aren't powerful enough to harm artifacts.

If the furnace isn't replenished every hour with at least 100 gp worth of treasure, the Engine Car sputters and the train comes to a halt, causing a guard patrol (see "Guard Patrols" earlier in the adventure) to investigate.

A creature that enters the furnace for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 55 (10d10) fire damage. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage dies and is reduced to a pile of ash.

The furnace door can be latched from the outside. A creature trapped inside the furnace can use an action to try to force open the door, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check.

**Treasure**
The treasure cart contains 3,500 gp, 6,000 sp, and 1,200 cp. Scattered among the coins are the following items:

Five amethysts (100 gp each)
Gilded mind flayer skull (150 gp)
Horn of Valhalla (silver)
Suit of mithral armor (chainmail)
Potion of healing (greater)
Silvered +3 greatsword that once belonged to a githyanki knight

- **Assistant Engineer** (junior staff member)
- **Thane Ironwhisper (Professor Stonetext)** - "Research" visits
