*Location: Lady's Ward*

As the party traverses the Lady's Ward, they meet a petitioner who is being questioned by a member of the Mercykillers, on the location of his father.

*This ward is full of expensive homes with breathtaking vistas and solemn streets where few people travel by foot. Several megastructures are situated in the heart of the ward, a grey slate tree-like building being the tallest of them. As you continue to walk deeper into the ward, the quiet at the street level is broken by the screeching sound of blades on stone. "Where is he, Fellik?", an angry voice demands. You turn toward the source and can see a humanoid in black armour and a dark hood threatening what looks like a blue, transparent ghost of a young man in a belted tunic who holds his hand up in front of his face. "I..I..don't know!"*

The ghostly petitioner is Fellik (from Chapter 6). The threatening humanoid is [[Amod Ka.webp||Amod Ka]], a Mercykiller Bloodhound. Amod is looking for Fellik's father Valder.

**The Return of Fellik.** Fellik died several years ago in Sigil and has only just now returned as a petitioner. He was taken to Excelsior from the Fugue Plane and taken to Excelsior to prove his devotion to Bahamut (Or Torm, or your favorite god of Mt. Celestia), but left to return to Sigil and find his father. Word of his return alerted the Mercykillers. Fellik honestly has no idea where his father is, but he knows a few people to ask, which is why he returned to S

**Valder.** Fellik's father, Valder is in Curst, hiding from the Mercykillers who are not allowed in the Gate-town. Valder refused to bring in a bounty he believed to be innocent. This deed led to several other faction members dying in the pursuit of this bounty after Valder let him go. The Mercykillers put a bounty on Valder and Amod aims to collect.

**[[Amod Ka.webp||Amod Ka]].** Amod isn't willing to let this lead go cold without some strong convincing. If the characters attempt to interfere Amod will explain the situation calmly.

- This is a cold lead on a bounty that needs collecting.
    
- It's not any of the party's concern and they should let the law go about its work.
    
- Unless they want to be put in a prison cell along with Valder, they need to move along.
    

A DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion) or (Intimidation) check makes Amod leave in a huff, with plans to keep tabs on Fellik.

If the characters fail, Amod threatens them once. If they make another check, he attacks. If the party reduces Amod to 50 hit points, he backs off, telling the party they've made a dangerous enemy.
