### Session 2

[[Adia Panamaa.webp||Adia Panama]] is accustomed with [[Clarion the Guardian||Clarion's]] network and activities. The tiefling swore that she has seen the PCs before but couldn't remember exactly how or when. The safest suspicion was to connect the sudden deaths and reappearances of barmies in the Hive with what might have happened to the PCs. 

In Session 2, the PCs tried to sneak in Adia's basement, their suspicion got the hold of them. She caught them sneaking it and due to her busy schedule and their embarrassment, she didn't quite threatened them, but politely asked them to leave the establishment. After the [[Through Hell and Back||incident in the Market Ward]], two ogres that were part of the product transport company whispered to one of the PCs that Adia wants to see them. 
The tiefling took the risk and trusted her gut (sensing the rebellious spirit of [[Rubicon]]) in inviting the PCs into her hideout, which was a [[Hands of Havoc]] hideout.
She gave them a brief explanation of Sigil's factions conflicts.
The PCs accepted a rather difficult quest, to free one important member of the Hands of Havoc that was being transported to Mechanus for his trial. The adventure that consists the escape of that man is being covered in [[Affair on the Concordant Express]] that will take place later in the story. As of now, Adia is trying to get her hands on some tickets for the Concordant Express, which are rather difficult to obtain. 

The PCs are headed towards the Hive, getting settler in [[Fiend's Salute Tavern]], meeting [[Clarion the Guardian]].

End of Session 2

### Session 3
Clarion will inform the PCs about Eliath, the missing man that his network is trying to spot in the Hive.
The only hint available to Clarion is that the murders happen predominantly in the Hive and he is sure to happen again tonight. The plan onwards is to keep one eye for any murder and the other for their own safety, since the Hive is a very dangerous place to roam about.
From here on, the [[Chapter I - The Hive||Chapter 1]] and [[Chapter II - The Mortuary||Chapter 2]] take place in order. 

Progressing from Session 3, the characters tracked down the murders in the Hive, while accustoming themselves warmly with Clarion.
The party met with the Dancing Man once, the Collectors, the Bleakers and Shadowknave, which escaped. All according to plan. Shadowknave's two hirelings were interrogated thoroughly and spitted out everything they knew. 
**The only lead now is the Mortuary, to meet Toranna and ask about Eliath's body.**

Shadowknave plans to sent an assassination elite team a couple of nights later to finish of the PCs. If the PCs manage to get to the bottom of this by the next session, on their first travel to the Mortuary, then Shadowknave will have probably failed to stop the PCs and probably resign completely from this mission. However, if the characters just visit the Mortuary and head back to get a rest's night, Shadowknave will attack.
Toranna would manipulatively manage to learn the location of the tavern the characters rest, allegedly to inform them about Eliath if she finds anything of value, and will later on sent Shadowknave to murder them at night.
This time, Shadowknave won't wire any mere Hireling, but someone or something with a murder intend.

End of Session 3
Level up to 4

### Session 4

PCs woke up from their restful nap prior to facing [[Shadowknave]] for the first time. Zill managed to interrogate one of his hirelings, connecting the mystery to the Mortuary, speaking to Toranna about Eliath. 

The barman advised the group that to call out Parissa's tout agency, called **Obsidian Eye Network**, they would have to throw 3 greens towards any surface, in order to make a sound. With such sound, one would be able to call out one of agency's touts. However, what he didn't inform them was that in order to successfully call this agency, one should generate a specific sound with the coins, a certain tempo. Zill successfully produced such sound after some attempts and [[Xamon_tout.png|Xamos]] arrived. 

PCs first stop was at Styx Oarsman, to let Orianna meet [[Valyndra.webp|Valyndra]].
Valyndra demanded from her warlock to accomplish the mission: to invade the [[Original Sin Cartel|Cartel]]. Orianna felt anxious about completing such a grand mission, troubled by the fact that her contract did not switched patrons as she remembered from her dream. 
Orianna's quest is to travel to Pazunia, the first layer of the Abyss, and into the tavern called Bucket of Blood. There she should meet a **certain individual** (might by another PC), acclimatizing her with the Cartel. 

Afterwards, the party travelled to the Mortuary. They didn't acquire any new information from Toranna, who didnt provide any new information, aside from the fact that Eliath has been cremated a couple of days ago. A week ago the [[The Collectors.webp|Collectors]] brought Eliath. The Mortuary keeps the barmies for a couple of days, to wait if any loved one of the victim wishes for a proper burial. If that doesn't happen, the Dustmen throw the bodies into the Elemental Plane of Fire.
PCs are not aware of the double sided nature of Toranna.

LO has also reunited with [[Bob, not a Blob Anymore]]. LO was in disbelief. After chit chatting for a bit, Bob let LO know that he's here for him and would help him, if his position allows that, in disentangling this mystery. Moreover, Bob mentioned the existence of the [[The Church of Experiments]], but didn't go into details. Skall, the factol of the Dustmen, keeps Bob occupied in the Mortuary. 

End of Session 4

### Session 5

We left the group encountering the Dancing Man atop a bridge that spans from the Lower Ward to the Hive. The characters stormed him with questions regarding his life and his wellness, only to learn that he acknowledges his past life, he is happy with the second chance he's given. He passed through the Eternal Boundary. Now in the garments of the Society of Sensation. The deity that had been shown to him is Sune.

Next up, they visited the Fiend's Saluter Inn, where they met Darius (the final member of the company). He suffers from the same fate as them and has contacts with Orianna. Darius kept a friendly demeanor with Clarion, and vice versa. 

Derioch showed up afterwards to inform them about Eliath and his appearance in the Lower Ward. Derioch insists something is wrong with the Mortuary and that the Dustmen are in deep. Also, she informed them that Shadowknave is a mercenary who keeps his hands bloody, and not with his own blood. 

The company headed towards the inn at the Lower Ward to find Eliath dressed in the colours of the Doomguards, alognside his patrol unit. They snatched him to the side secretly, only to get the same result as the Dancing Man: he is content with his second chance and there's no way they will ruin it for him. The deity that appeared to him through the passage of the Eternal Boundary is Jergal. 

Later on, they decided to revisit the Mortuary, only this time demanding more pressing information. After some shenanigans, they managed to get to Toranna's room and Rubicon turned invisible, sneaking in her room, finding a symbol of Cyric and the beads to the Elemental Plane of Fire. He took them with him, except the symbol.

After not being able to find anything useful out of Toranna, Darius decided to charm her, thus learning the entire truth about the Reverie. About its leader, their goal, their motives. As well as the nature of the Citadel of fire, being the headquarters of the Reverie and it's occupants. The key to the portal is the red beads she keeps in her drawer. Toranna, while charmed, agreed to provide them passage to the Citadel, however when returning to retrieve the beads, she found that the drawer was empty. Somebody has stolen the beads.

At that time, Rubicon decided to assassinate Toranna, dealing a great deal of damage to her, however he did not  expect her to live. She managed to give her all, fighting until completely dead. She didn't raise any alarm, the PCs knew the truth about her being the double agent in the hood of the Mortuary, and if Skall learned about her intrusion, death would be the mercy he would show to her. 

She felt to the floor, while Darius smartly took her form with a Disguise Self spell. They wrapped her in mummification cloths and Darius ordered some Dustmen to incinerate her into one of the portals. He passed the Diplomacy check and the guards didn't respond, they followed orders of Toranna.

Darius stays in the Mortuary disguised as Toranna. In the meantime, the PCs return to their rooms to lick their wounds and think this through.

End of session 5.

### Session 6

- Members of the Red Circuit attacked the Fiend's Salute Inn
- Killed Red Circuit and Shadowknave. LO acquired the transmitter which he have to fully identify first
- Darius returned swiftly to the Mortuary
- Zill tries to speak with dead as ritual using solely the head of Shadowknave. A nightmare of Bhaal appeared not letting him successfully cast them spell, or better not letting the spirit of Shadowknave to speak with him. The spirit of Shadowknave has been claimed by Bhaal and he speaks through him
- Next morning they headed to the Mortuary and meet with Darius
- Darius (Toranna) was summoned to the factol's secretary office by Komosahl. He announced that he's aware with the fiasco of the Citadel and wants to terminate this business, whoever is hiding underneath Toranna. Then dismissed him.
- The party disguised with the spell Seeming using the guises of Toranna, Shadowknave and some hirelings. 
- They bypassed most of the Citadel's surrounding. They toured around, but not fully, resulting in Imogen's office. 
- She was confused as to why they appeared here, but after explaining to her that there is a certain group of characters that claim to have been returned from the dead, she got hooked up and raised her interests in meeting them. She dismissed Toranna to summon these characters here at once.
- The characters instead of leaving, hid in the next room (14)

### Session 7

- The characters decided to directly engage in combat with everyone.
- Imogen tried to reason with them while taking a defensive position, but the characters attacked regardless.
- They are trying to find an obsidian plate to host the jewel (core). 
- We ended the session in the barmies



### Session 8

- They successfully retrieved the core and saved the barmies.
- The barmies scattered in the Mortuary.
- The party returned to Fiend's Salute Tavern.
- They encountered a talk between [[Skarn_Altheriel_Thitch.webp]] and [[Clarion the Guardian]] regarding the Coup back in their homeland, in Sylvania. A corrupted Wolf Lord has ascended to leadership under suspicious circumstances and begun replacing the minority of the guardinals with his kind. 
- They showed the [[Emberheart Core]] to [[Shafi Bin Ahmad Zin]]. This NPC has been suggested by Clarion. Their relational terms are not the best, but are trustworthy, Shafi being a Fated and Clarion a guardinal/Free League. In a past event they have cooperated under an endeavor that had to step aside their philosophical views on certain things. Clarion suggested that if the party wants to help somehow, they are more than welcomed. They can find them at the Fortress of Unyielding Resolve.
- Shafi won't betray them or reveal their secret to anyone. He's a research enthusiast and a mechanical genius when in comes to cogs. He mentioned that in order to host and exploit the power of the core, one must encapsulate it in an infernal iron device. The stone tablet that they bring had anti-magic properties to actually contain and make a place breathable in extreme hot temperatures. This stone comes directly from the Elemental Plane of Fire. Infernal Iron will transform the core from a heat source into a magical item, exerting its magical properties.

- cold stone slab pressed to your spine
- industrial smog of sigil claws down your throat
- The Wolf Lord terrorize in Faunel (guardinal tongue)

### Session 10

- introduced eerie familiarity with Josbert
- he was going to refuge them in some place in the Lower Ward to be safe from Harmonium for the time being
- the encounter in the canals exploded, the spirits transformed into a [[Spectral Beholder]]
- Josbert mentioned making some short of offering or a respectful rite to calm the spirits.
- Zill performed the speak with the dead musically and the beholder fixed its gaze on him, demanding to bring it it's family's crest down in the waters.
- Nibi and Rubicon swum downwards. The mausoleum that was drowned beneath the undersigil contained 2 portals to some Shar-related planes of existence.
- Also Nibi found the signet wrapped around an algae, which caused Nibi to see visions of Lord Enveris' past and the demise of the family that was buried in this mausoleum.
- Lord Enveris (the beholder itself) focused his eye and destroyed the ring, freeing themselves from Shar's curse. 
- From the ring's destruction, the splash of necrotic energy nearly killed Zill.
- The explosion made him unconscious, finding himself in the Fugue Plane
- There he met Bhaal. He demanded blood and murder. He didn't appreciate that the gang prevented Shadowknave's journey to Bhaal's domain. 
- Finally, they managed to reach the old safehouse, where they made a short rest.

Note to Self:  Zill died and encounter Bhaal. During the next long rest a helping hand should appear, someone that can severe this persistent affliction that had been cast on Zill, from back when he searched for revenge of his fathers. This saviour should be decided! Someone opposing Bhaal.

### Session 11

- Party considers going to either Outlands or the casino. Even to Rigus.
- Josbert slightly pushed them going to the casino, making mentions about the chip being a calling card–Shemeshka was overlooking.
- They arrived to Fortune's Wheel without issue. Josbert left them.
- Valek welcomed and guided them to their rooms, as Shemeshka was waiting for them. 
- After they changed, the went to the casino itself, showing the platinum chip to Vez.
- They wandered around and played games. Some activities that stood out:

	- Zill drunk a cocktail served by the yeti at the glacier bar.
	- Orianna gambled with the lesser wheels.
	- Rubicon met Ignatius who the mindflayer interrogated. Ignatius passed him the coordinates that the Concordant Express departs. He passed the information that something is being cooked on the train and he plans to find out. He hopes that Rubicon is on the right side of this case–whichever this side might be!
- After a while, Shemeshka descended and met the patrons of the casino.
- She stopped an intrusion from the Harmonium to arrest the players, but before she could actually speak with them personally, the glitch occurred.
- The gambling machines modrons begun spewing hot coins, injuring the patrons and a rift to Mechanus begun materialising above their heads that would eventually absorb everything in the casino. 
- R04M made his escape, delivering the parchment (portal key) to LO, before de-materialising itself (absorbed by Mechanus).
- Before LO completed reading the parchment and successfully teleport away, he met the gaze of Shemeshka–a cunning look of acknowledgement. 
	- Shemeshka is intrigued. R04M's escape and the characters involvement won't go unnoticed. 
- The characters arrived in the Outlands, a bit further away from the gate-town of Torch. Near them, a magenta forest opens up, with mechanical trials of something huge leading to that forest.

- In a stealthy killing blow, Bhaal "forced" the way of Zill to invoke critical damage.
- Laxuelu, the gith in the sarcophagus, whispered in Nibi's mind "Save the knowledge" when they were wondering if they should fight or leave. 
- Short rest
