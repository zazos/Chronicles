# THESIS Monday TODO

- Prepare the mp3s to use as the test split has changed
	- Trying to find manually in which subfolder every mp3 is located is inefficient.
- No need to print the probabilities of all labels. Simply the highest alongside its percentage
	- Same goes for the recommendation track
- Valence/Arousal map doesn't show the region of the values.
- Validate that the other visualizations work
	- Parallel coordinates is outdated
