### _The Styx Oarsman – A Den of Fiendish Indulgence_

The air in Heward’s Forks is thick with the acrid scent of burning refuse and stagnant water. The _Styx Oarsman_ looms like a wart on Sigil’s underbelly, its crooked, two-story form slouched against the winding roads of the Lower Ward. The street outside is a morass of discarded bones, trampled refuse, and the occasional glistening smear of something best left unidentified. The foul statue at the square’s heart is slick with avian filth, its jagged edges hosting squabbling executioner’s ravens whose rasping cries echo through the air.

The entrance to the tavern is framed by rusted iron posts, warped by years of exposure to planar energies. A trio of lesser fiends loiters outside, wrapped in the shadows and whispering to each other in Abyssal. The glow of their malevolent eyes flickers briefly as they take note of your approach, one sneering before returning to his whispered conspiracies.

At the door, _Jarkman Vries_ stands like a gnarled post of muscle and spite, his infernal cigar glowing like a tiny ember against the dimness. His tiefling heritage is evident in his curling black horns, his jaundiced eyes flicking over the party with an expression somewhere between contempt and amusement. His arquebus, a piece of deadly craftsmanship from Cormyr’s arsenal, rests comfortably against his shoulder, its polished silver-engraved butt-guard gleaming in what little light the Lower Ward offers.

“Lower Planars only,” he growls, his voice like crushed gravel. “Unless you got jink to change my mind, or a reason I _should_ let you in.”

Should Orianna slip him a suitable bribe, or invoke the name of a trusted regular, Vries huffs a cloud of bluish smoke from his cigar and steps aside, pushing open the heavy, iron-bound door with a grunt.

Inside, the _Styx Oarsman_ is a cavern of shadows and malign revelry. The air is thick with the mingling scents of scorched meat, spilled infernal liquor, and the faint but unmistakable undertone of old blood. A few flickering candles provide meager illumination, their light barely reaching the farthest booths where silhouettes shift and whisper in tongues most mortals should never hear.

A twisted array of fiendish patrons—_tanar’ri, yugoloths, gehreleths, tieflings, and other infernal oddities_—gather around the warped wooden tables, sharing conspiratorial whispers, snarled threats, and the occasional guttural laugh. The _Skiff Table_, its surface carved with hundreds of names, blood sigils, and abyssal runes, is occupied by a trio of fiends who eye the newcomers with vague interest before returning to their dealings.

_Gennick the Mesmer_ stands near the bar, his rainbow-hued robe flowing like an oil slick as he twirls his iron staff—home to the vrock imprisoned within. His sharp, slitted gaze lingers on Orianna for a moment before turning away in evident disinterest. For now.

Behind the bar, _Quinsy_ and _Lathly Dim_ argue over something in hoarse, guttural voices, their movements practiced as they pour out drinks that hiss and writhe with unnatural potency. A hooded figure sips from a mug that seems to exude black smoke, and in the farthest corner, perched on a stool near the taps, sits a figure of _undeniable authority and cruel beauty._

Valyndra.

### _The Meeting – A Warlock and Her Patron_

The Erinyes is an island of controlled menace amid the chaos of the tavern. She sits with an air of ownership, the flickering candlelight reflecting off the sharp, midnight-black edges of her infernal armour . Her _crimson wings_, folded yet imposing, shift subtly with each of her slow, deliberate movements. The scent of smoldering embers clings to her presence, and her eyes—_twin orbs of consuming fire_—settle on Orianna as though peeling apart her very soul.

At her feet, a small _impish form_ flickers into visibility—Blib, ever-present, ever-mocking.

Blib: (grinning, tail flicking) “Ohhh, she _definitely_ looks mad, Orianna. Wonder what you did this time? Maybe she found out you pet a puppy last week.”

Valyndra doesn’t immediately acknowledge the imp’s insolence. Instead, she motions for Orianna to sit across from her with a single movement of her clawed hand.

Valyndra: (low, commanding) _“You kept me waiting, little one.”_

A pause, the air between them thick with expectation.

Valyndra: _“Do you know why I have called you here? Or must I educate you once more on the importance of our... arrangement?”_

Her words are silk wrapped around a dagger—seductive, dangerous, and laced with an authority that promises suffering if disobeyed.

### _Possible Player Responses & Dialogue Options_

**1. Deferential & Loyal:**  
Orianna: _"Forgive me, my lady. I live only to serve. Command me, and it shall be done."_

_Valyndra smirks, clearly pleased. She leans forward, her voice purring with satisfaction._  
Valyndra: _“Good. You are learning. There is a poison in the Abyss, and I intend for you to be its antidote… or perhaps its rival toxin.”_

---

**2. Wary & Questioning:**  
Orianna: _"I serve you, but I do not blindly obey. What would you have me do?"_

_Valyndra’s expression hardens, her fiery gaze narrowing._  
Valyndra: _“Ah, my warlock has found her spine. I wonder, will you still stand upright when the weight of my displeasure rests upon you?”_ (A moment’s pause, then a sigh of indulgence.) _“You will listen, Orianna, and you will do as you are told. Or I will find another.”_

---

**3. Defiant & Resentful:**  
Orianna: _"I did what you asked. I am no puppet."_

_Blib lets out a high-pitched laugh before quickly silencing himself as Valyndra shifts in her seat._  
Valyndra: _(voice like a blade scraping against stone)_ “A puppet? No. Puppets are without will. You have will, and that makes you _useful_—until the moment you are not. Do not test my patience, warlock.”

### _Valyndra's Orders_

Once the warlock has spoken, Valyndra finally leans back, fingers tapping idly on the hilt of her wickedly curved blade.

Valyndra: _“There is a festering blight in the Abyss, a network of serpents with ambitions far too grand for their standing. The Cartel must be severed from within, their delicate alliances shattered.”_

She gestures subtly, conjuring an _illusory vision of a succubus_—Nari. A creature of ambition, vanity, and barely-contained greed.

Valyndra: _“You will be the blade I wield in the darkness, but you must strike quietly, unnoticed. There is one, Nari, who is ripe for manipulation—use her lust for power, her arrogance. Through her, the entire Cartel may be brought to its knees.”_

A pause, then a final warning.

Valyndra: _“Fail me not, my beloved tool, for the fires of my wrath are far greater than the Abyss itself.”_

The candlelight flickers, the shadow of her wings casting a long, ominous silhouette across the bar. The weight of her expectations hangs heavy in the air.

Blib: (muttering, tail twitching) “Oh yeah, no pressure at all, huh?”
