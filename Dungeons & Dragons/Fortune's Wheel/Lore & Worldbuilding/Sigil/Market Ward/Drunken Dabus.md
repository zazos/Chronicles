_Astoria Road, Market Ward_

This modest tavern is run by the outward and friendly [[Adia Panamaa.webp | Adia Panamma]] *(planar tiefling fighter [she/her] / Hands of Havoc / CN)*. She has small yellowish conical horns, somewhat hidden in her thick turquoise hair. Her face looks just as any normal humans would except for her eyes are feline. Her fingernails are always red, as if she was wearing nail polish, but it never seems to change in shade. Though hidden most of the time, you will notice if she personally shows you to your room, she has a long thin tail extending from the tails of her coat.

The Drunken Dabus is a fairly new inn, clearly visible by the tables which seem to lack the vulgar graffiti common to older inns. The bar serves a wide variety of drinks you will find nowhere else. The Inn also serves full meals and has a meeting room which can be reserved for parties. The Drunken Dabus has twenty four rooms about half of which are vacant at all times. Rooms run around 8 stingers a night, but if you want a private bath the suites run about 3 jinx a night, long term stays can be negotiated.

**The Dark:** Adia Panamaa is a cell leader for the Hands of Havoc and often the meeting room is in use by her and her cell. I’ve heard whispers that she is currently working on plans to assassinate Factol Sarin of the Harmonium. Also underneath the inn lies a small section of the catacombs. A cavern in the torus, unlike most of Undersigil, this area is very clean and well lit with many oil lanterns. This is the place where Adia hides her members of her cell when a Harmonium patrol enters the dabus for a little afternoon refreshment. Within this are there are two doorways, one from the inn into the cavern, and one leading in to larger parts and other pathways of the catacombs. This is also an area where Adia keeps weapons, scrolls, magical items, and the like for slightly more devious uses then her outward appearance may describe.

I managed to smuggle a drinks menu out of the tavern, and have included it below, along with my thoughts on the contents of these drinks. Let it be known Brix is happy to research his _Guides_ thoroughly! Please note that many mortals may find some of these beverages poisonous.

The adventure Affairs on the Concordant Express is for 9th level characters, so it will have to wait a bit longer.

#### **The Reunion with Adia**

In the bustling, dimly-lit tavern of the Dusty Mirror, the PCs spot Adia, a known member of the Hands of Havoc. If any PC shows interest in the faction or resonates with its ideology, Adia’s eyes widen in disbelief upon seeing them for the first time. Despite her shock, she maintains a composed facade, continuing her duties without acknowledging them.

Later, as the tavern’s patrons thin out and the atmosphere grows quieter, Adia approaches the PC with a sense of urgency. She leans in close, whispering, “I can’t believe you are alive. How?”

Once she’s certain they won’t be overheard, Adia discreetly leads the PCs to a hidden trapdoor beneath the inn. The safehouse below is a haven from Sigil’s prying eyes, where the walls themselves seem to possess ears, eyes, and mouths. Here, in the safety of this concealed room, Adia finally allows herself to express her bewilderment and relief.

“I remember you… barely,” Adia admits, her voice a mix of confusion and familiarity. “It’s like a gut feeling, but stronger. We were friends, members of the Hands of Havoc. You didn’t survive a mission—was it for the faction, or something personal? I can’t recall the details.”

Adia then shifts to the matter at hand. She explains the critical mission she has for the party: rescuing a key member of the Hands of Havoc known as the Stranger. “The Stranger holds the True Names of powerful fiends, an asset too dangerous to fall into the wrong hands. He’s being transported to Mechanus aboard the Concordant Express for his final verdict. We need to save him.”

With a determined look, Adia hands over a golden ticket. “This will get you to the Concordant Express station. Use it wisely. The Stranger’s knowledge could turn the tide in our favor, but it won’t be easy. Mechanus is relentless.”

As the PCs take the ticket, Adia’s eyes convey a mix of hope and desperation. “Good luck. And remember, in Sigil, not even the shadows are safe.”
