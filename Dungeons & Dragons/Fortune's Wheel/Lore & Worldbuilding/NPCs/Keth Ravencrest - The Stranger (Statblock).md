## Roleplay Notes

**Personality:** Defiant but protective, uses dark humor to cope with danger
**Mannerisms:** Constantly tests his shackles, speaks in coded anarchist language
**Voice:** Sardonic wit with underlying steel determination

### Key Dialogue
> "You're either very brave or very stupid to attempt this. I appreciate both qualities."
> 
> "The names I carry could reshape three planes. That's why they'll kill me before Automata."

## Current Condition

**Physical State:** Weakened by interrogation, bruised but not broken
**Mental State:** Alert and calculating, maintains anarchist resolve
**Equipment Status:** All gear confiscated, held in Car 7 security locker

### The Dimensional Shackles
- **Material:** Enchanted adamantine with anti-magic field generator  
- **Effect:** Prevents all teleportation, planar travel, and conjuration magic
- **Weakness:** Can be unlocked with thieves' tools (DC 25) or dispel magic (9th level)
- **Removal Time:** 2 full rounds of uninterrupted work

## Combat Tactics

**If Freed Mid-Combat:**
1. Casts *mage armor* and *stoneskin* immediately
2. Uses *misty step* to create distance
3. Provides support with *counterspell* and battlefield control
4. Prioritizes escape over engagement

**Desperate Measures:**
- Will use yugoloth True Names if party is overwhelmed
- Threatens to cast *time stop* and destroy his own memories if captured by Shemeshka
- Uses *teleport* for emergency extraction once shackles are removed

## The True Names

If rescued and trusted, The Stranger can share knowledge of:
1. **Vorthak the Chain-Binder** (Ultroloth)
2. **Jessith Skinweaver** (Nycaloth) 
3. **Zerathen "Moloch's Whisper"** (Arcanaloth)
4. **Nyth-Talar "The Gilded Serpent"** (Connected to Shemeshka)

*Using these names grants command over the yugoloth for 24 hours, but also marks the user as a target for yugoloth revenge.*
