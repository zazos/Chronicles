**The Master's Betrayal**: The Master was once a powerful figure within the Church of Experiments, perhaps even a **high-ranking priest** or **teacher**. However, his thirst for personal power and the desire to transcend even the limits the Church placed on him led him to abandon his followers. His goal: to become a **Necromaton**—a form of immortality that bends the line between arcane and science.

**The Fire and the Church’s Attack**: The **Church of Experiments** raided the lab, viewing the Master’s unsanctioned experiments as an abomination. The fire and explosion that LO barely escaped were caused by the Church's forces, who aimed to eradicate the Master's creations. However, the Church wasn't entirely successful, and they now hunt down LO and any surviving creations, branding them as "unmanifested threats" that could hold hidden, dangerous power.


## **The Church’s Secret Research: "Debugging" The Flickers**

- The **Church now experiments on Flickers**, searching for **clues to prevent the transformation into a Necromaton**.
- They **see Flickers as warning signs**, people **on the edge of becoming like the Master**.
- Instead of **treating Flickers like rabid animals**, they **now try to "fix" them**, **unwilling to admit** they have lost control.
- **Some of the Church’s hidden facilities** are **dedicated to dissecting Flickers**, looking for a way to **"debug" them** before they reach **full Necromaton status**.
