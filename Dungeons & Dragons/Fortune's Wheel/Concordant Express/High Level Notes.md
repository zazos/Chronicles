## The Outlands Station

- **Arrival:** The party, now wanted criminals, uses the coordinates from Ignatius Inkblot to arrive at the Concordant Express station in the Outlands. 
    
- **The "Ticket" Drop:** Subordinates of Adia Panama are waiting for the party. They can play out a scene where they "deliver" the tickets, perhaps with a coded phrase or signal to identify the party. The subordinates can also provide a crucial piece of information, such as the car number where the Stranger is being held.
    
- **Foreshadowing:** While waiting for the train, the party can spot other key players at the station, planting the seeds of the rivalries to come. They might see:
    - A contingent of stern-looking **Mechanus guards** overseeing the loading of a special cargo.
    - A shady group of individuals (the **yugoloths**) trying to remain inconspicuous.
	    - Sent by Shemeshka
    - **Ignatius Inkblot** himself, perhaps observing the party from a distance before boarding the train separately.
