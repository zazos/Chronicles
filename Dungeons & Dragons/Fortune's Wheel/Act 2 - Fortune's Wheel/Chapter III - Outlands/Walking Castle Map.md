### W1: Terrace

*A paved ring with a 2-foot-high lip provides a foundation for the castle. The base of the tower opens into a hall without exterior doors. Along the west and
east interior walls of this hall are doors that lead inside (W2).*

- The door to the east is locked. 
- The door to the west has been shattered inward.

### W2: Library
<img src="walking_castle_main_entrance.webp" class="rightimg" height=500>

[[walking_castle_main_entrance.webp|Show To Players]]

*All manner of tomes, scrolls, tablets, and folios cram the towering shelves of this airy library. An ancient wooden table surrounded by matching benches stands at the
room’s center, near an ornate spiral staircase that climbs through the ceiling above. To the north are statues of githzerai scholars and an alcove with a table covered in candles. 
To the south, in another alcove, stands a crystal sarcophagus.*

The library holds the collected writings of Iedcaru’s scholars. The majority focus on esoteric philosophies of the Outer Planes and multiversal theories.
The spiral stairs rise to area W3.

**North Alcove.** This alcove holds two braziers, a threadbare mat, and a table covered in candles and used incense sticks.

**Sarcophagus.** Visible through the transparent lid of this sarcophagus is the mummified body of Iedcaru’s first caretaker, the githzerai scholar [[Laxuelu.webp]],
whose name is etched on the lid. The mummy has brass eyes, and its sarcophagus can’t be opened. Whenever a creature in the library speaks its desire
for a text on a particular topic, the mummy’s eyes magically move to look in the direction of a relevant work in the collection (if it exists).

**Treasure.** Among the candles in the alcove sits a partially melted candle of invocation of a random alignment that has 1 hour of use remaining.

### W3: Main Room

If the characters enter stealthily and eavesdrop, the can overhear the tiefling here discussing about betraying Thlaarsh.

*A spiral staircase emerges through the floor into this multi-use kitchen and social area. To the north, a ladder ascends to the floor above, and six simple doors ring the room. To the west are several cabinets and cooking spaces that have been pillaged, with pots and foodstuffs scattered across the floor. Two tieflings in spiked armor conspire over the table.*

The tieflings are neutral evil gladiators in the service of [[Thlaarsh, the Gore Drinker|Thlaarsh]] (see area W5). They’re hostile, but a character who succeeds on a DC 18 Charisma
(Intimidation or Persuasion) check or who offers each tiefling at least 1,000 gp convinces the pair to betray their yugoloth allies. Otherwise, the tieflings
scream battle cries as they fight to the death. If the characters don’t silence the tieflings quickly, the Fiends in areas W5, W6, and W7 are alerted.

> "Where do you thing you're going *Zar'kesh*? You have no business here. The castle is under new management–ours"

Zar'kesh (Infernal) translates, literally, to Lemure-spawn and metaphorically to bastard.

**Supplies.** The kitchen has been plundered, but 14 days of rations remain. These mostly consist of pickled radishes—a favorite of Zaythir’s.
### W4: bedroom

The following bedrooms surround the main room:

**W4a.** This room has a single bed, a desk, and a cabinet containing loose robes.

**W4b.** This room has two beds, a writing desk, and an empty cabinet.

**W4c.** This room contains a large nest, once used by an avian scholar, and a cabinet with clothes suited for a winged wearer. A door to the east opens onto
a sturdy log perch covered in old talon scratches.

### W5: Study

If [[Thlaarsh, the Gore Drinker]] in this room is aware of the characters, it casts **invisibility**. When a character enters the room, read or paraphrase the following, leaving out
the last sentence if the nycaloth is invisible:

*A sizeable desk stands opposite the door in this stuffy study. Cabinets, crowded bookshelves, and maps of the Outer Planes cover the room’s walls. In the south corner stands a simple cot. 
(if not invisible) A hulking, green-skinned figure with mighty wings and razor-sharp claws violently peruses the books, discarding those that displease it.*

> You dare interrupt my studies? I will peel your skin from your skulls!

> Pathetic mortals. Surrender now and i might let you serve as my test subjects.

> You’re not worth the contract, but the entertainment will suffice.

This is Zaythir’s study. The nycaloth [[Thlaarsh, the Gore Drinker]] is here, seeking ways to make the castle move. Thlaarsh attacks rival trespassers and
fights to the death, but it tries to capture spellcasters, hoping to make them pilot the castle.

**Treasure.** The desk holds [[Zaythir|Zaythir’s]] notes on the Outlands, which are written in Gith, as well as calligrapher's supplies. On the desk is a broken [[Mimir Knowledge|Mimir]] with a skull made of colourful glass shards.

### W6: Castellan Chamber

If the three [[Mezzoloth|mezzoloths]] in this room were alerted by noise in area W3, they cast darkness before the characters enter. Otherwise, read or paraphrase the
following when a character enters the room:

*This chamber is dominated by a sculpture of a gigantic, humanlike figure looming over a broad, circular table. A ladder to the north descends, while a ladder to the south climbs to the floor above. Three four-armed, insectile creatures inspect the sculpture and table, trying to break them loose.*

> "Amuse us with your suffering!"

**[[Iadecaru_castellan.webp|Castellan]].** The statue and table here are together a unique magical being known as the Castellan. It is dormant when the characters initially enter this
room.

**Secret Door.** A character who investigates the south wall and succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds a secret door that slides open.
In this space is a small table on which sit several candles and a **necklace of prayer beads** with 1d4 + 2 magic beads.

### W7: Meditation Chamber

The lights have been destroyed in this area

*Ancient tapestries of the planes and cosmic alignments cover the walls of this simple room. Ladders descend to the floor below and rise to the level above.*

### W8: Signal Tower

*Narrow windows look out from this stark stone chamber in every direction. In the room’s center stands a green crystal atop a stone pillar. A ladder descends to the floor below. Seated in a corner is a githyanki woman with long, white hair and closed eyes.*

The Fiends have kept the castle’s caretaker, a neutral githzerai uniter named **Zaythir**, in this chamber.
**Zaythir** is eager to be free and evict the devils from her home.

**Crystal.** The green crystal affixed to the pedestal is a gem of brightness. When the gem is lit, its light can be seen over a mile away.

---

Once the Fiends are defeated and Zaythir is freed, the characters have access to the walking castle and the gratitude of its residents. These residents help
the characters however they can.

**The Castellan**
This magical wonder is inert when the characters first enter area W6. Zaythir can reactivate it with a word, at which point its body animates and the table
before it projects an illusory image of the Outlands.
The Castellan has the following features:
- The Castellan is neutral and has an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12.
- The Castellan has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, and it can understand Common and Gith but can’t speak. It communicates through gestures alone.
- The Castellan can cause Iedcaru to stand or sit. While the castle stands, its lowest level is 40 feet off the ground. The castle can walk at the rate of 12 miles per hour, but it can go no faster or slower.
- The Castellan controls the walking castle and is friendly toward those who rescued Zaythir. If the Castellan’s attitude changes, a character must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince it to navigate the castle.
- The Castellan is indestructible so long as the walking castle stands.
