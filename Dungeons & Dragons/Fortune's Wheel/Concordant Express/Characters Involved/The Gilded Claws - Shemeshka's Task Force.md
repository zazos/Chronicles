# The Gilded Claws - Shemeshka's Task Force

*"Precision, elegance, and absolute discretion. Leave no trace, leave no witnesses, leave no room for failure."*

## Organization Overview

**The Gilded Claws** are Shemeshka's elite infiltration unit, specializing in high-stakes operations requiring subtlety and plausible deniability. Unlike her usual information brokers and casino enforcers, the Gilded Claws are her "wet work" specialists—though they prefer "problem resolution consultants."

### Operational Parameters

**Primary Mission:** Acquire The Stranger alive for interrogation regarding yugoloth True Names

**Secondary Mission:** If capture proves impossible, eliminate The Stranger completely—body, soul, and any written records he may have hidden

**Tertiary Mission:** Maintain complete deniability—no evidence must trace back to Shemeshka or Fortune's Wheel

## Task Force Composition

### Leader: Vex "Golden Tongue" Maraleth
**Race:** Tiefling (Zariel bloodline)  
**Class:** Warlock/Rogue (Level 8)  
**Role:** Field Commander & Face

A charismatic tiefling with golden-flecked skin and immaculate dress sense. Vex poses as a wealthy merchant's daughter traveling to Automata on business. Her honeyed words hide a razor-sharp mind and complete moral flexibility.

**Abilities:**
- Master of disguise and social manipulation
- Eldritch powers masked as "family heirloom" magic items
- Expertise in reading people's motivations and fears

**Cover Identity:** "Seraphina Goldweaver," textile merchant heiress

### Infiltrator: Kess the Whisper
**Race:** Halfling  
**Class:** Rogue (Arcane Trickster) (Level 7)  
**Role:** Stealth Specialist & Security Bypass

A unremarkable-looking halfling who specializes in becoming invisible in plain sight. Kess has infiltrated the train staff as a junior conductor, giving her access to restricted areas and passenger manifests.

**Abilities:**
- Expert lockpicking and trap disarmament
- Minor illusion magic for misdirection
- Knowledge of train security protocols and guard rotations

**Cover Identity:** "Pip Thornwick," junior conductor (3rd shift)

### Muscle: Thane Ironwhisper
**Race:** Duergar  
**Class:** Fighter (Eldritch Knight) (Level 8)  
**Role:** Heavy Enforcement & Elimination Specialist

A grim duergar dressed as a traveling scholar, complete with wire-rim spectacles and leather satchel full of "historical texts." Beneath his academic facade lies a cold-blooded killer who specializes in making deaths look accidental.

**Abilities:**
- Master of "invisible" weapons (poison, magic, environmental)
- Duegar racial abilities for stealth and size manipulation
- Contingency spells for emergency extraction

**Cover Identity:** "Professor Aldric Stonetext," historical researcher

### Support: Nyth the Silence
**Race:** Yuan-ti Pureblood  
**Class:** Cleric (Trickery Domain) (Level 6)  
**Role:** Magical Support & Information Warfare

A serpentine humanoid posing as a traveling healer. Nyth provides magical support to the team while also serving as their information specialist—monitoring communications, reading thoughts, and erasing memories when necessary.

**Abilities:**
- Mind reading and memory modification
- Healing magic to maintain covers and aid allies
- Pass Without Trace and other stealth enchantments

**Cover Identity:** "Sister Melody," traveling healer from a Celestian order

## Tactical Approach

### Phase 1: Intelligence Gathering (Hours 1-3)
- Vex mingles with passengers, identifying potential allies and threats
- Kess maps security protocols and locates The Stranger's exact position
- Thane scouts escape routes and elimination opportunities
- Nyth establishes magical surveillance on key areas

### Phase 2: Positioning (Hours 3-5)
- Team moves into optimal positions for capture attempt
- Backup elimination methods prepared and positioned
- Counter-intelligence against other factions (especially Ignatius)
- Contingency plans activated

### Phase 3: Execution (Hours 5-7)
- Primary capture attempt during meal service or shift change
- If successful: immediate extraction to prepared safe room
- If failed: switch to elimination protocol

### Phase 4: Cleanup (Hours 7-8)
- Evidence destruction and witness management
- Emergency extraction if operation compromised
- Preparation for Automata arrival with secured objective

## Resources & Equipment

### Magical Assets
- **Communication Crystals:** Linked to Shemeshka for real-time updates
- **Dimension Door Scrolls:** Emergency extraction from train
- **Memory Modification Kit:** Potions and components for witness amnesia
- **Soul Trap:** Magical item to capture The Stranger's essence if killed

### Mundane Resources
- **Forged Documentation:** Perfect papers for all cover identities
- **Bribery Fund:** 2,000 gold pieces for "unexpected complications"
- **Poison Arsenal:** Various substances for elimination scenarios
- **Medical Supplies:** To maintain healer cover and treat injuries

### Information Network
- **Passenger Manifest:** Complete list with background checks
- **Security Briefing:** Train guard schedules and protocols
- **Architecture Plans:** Detailed train car layouts and escape routes
- **Weather Predictions:** Environmental factors affecting operation

## Contingency Plans

### If Party Interferes
- Attempt to frame party for disrupting "legitimate" passenger safety
- Use Nyth's mind magic to turn party members against each other
- Retreat and regroup, shifting to elimination protocol

### If Ignatius Investigates
- Vex attempts to seduce/manipulate the detective
- Kess plants false evidence pointing to Hands of Havoc involvement
- Avoid direct confrontation—Ignatius is too dangerous mentally

### If Train Security Responds
- Thane creates "accident" to distract guards
- Nyth uses healing magic to aid "injured" passengers (gaining trust)
- Kess uses conductor authority to redirect security attention

### If Operation Fails Completely
- **Scorched Earth Protocol:** Eliminate The Stranger, all witnesses, and potentially crash train car
- **Testimony Cleanup:** Memory modification of all survivors
- **Trail Erasure:** Destroy all evidence linking back to Shemeshka

## Success Metrics

### Optimal Success
- The Stranger captured alive and delivered to Shemeshka
- No evidence of Gilded Claws involvement
- Other factions believe operation was Harmonium security action

### Acceptable Success
- The Stranger eliminated, True Names remain secret
- Minimal collateral damage and exposure
- Shemeshka maintains plausible deniability

### Failure Threshold
- The Stranger escapes with knowledge intact
- Gilded Claws identity exposed
- Evidence leads back to Fortune's Wheel

*"Remember, we are not assassins—we are consultants. We do not kill—we resolve problems. We do not steal—we recover assets. Semantics matter in this business, as does presentation. Make it clean, make it quiet, and make it profitable."*
