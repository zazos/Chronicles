# R04M, the Glitch Incarnate
<img src="R04M.webp" class="rightimg" height=500>

 **R04M** is a monodrone who, through a catastrophic series of events, has become the living embodiment of a corrupted narrative. Once a simple cog in the great machine of Mechanus, he is now a walking, talking paradox—a creature of pure law hopelessly scrambled by chaos. He is the patient zero of the reality reboot, and therefore, the only key to fixing it.

### Personality and Motivation

R04M is a broken program running on a loop of pure, panicked desperation. His core personality—the meticulous, duty-bound observer—has been shattered. What remains is a singular, overwhelming drive: **"UPLOAD MUST BE COMPLETED. NARRATIVE MUST BE CORRECTED. ERROR. ERROR. ERROR."**

 He cannot speak in coherent, linear sentences. He speaks in bursts of corrupted data, mixing fragments of the "original canonical events" with panicked error messages and pleas for help.
 
 His sense of duty, once a source of strength, is now his flaw. It's what drove him to attempt the solo upload, and it's what drives him now. He knows he is the key, he knows the players are important, and he knows the timeline is wrong, but he lacks the logical capacity to explain it. He is a frantic, unreliable narrator of his own and the party's story.

 He is *deeply afraid*. He is aware, on some level, of how broken he is. When he sees the players, there's a flicker of recognition, a desperate hope that these "canonical figures" can somehow debug his existence. He is a prisoner in his own mind, haunted by a history he can no longer properly recall but feels responsible for.
