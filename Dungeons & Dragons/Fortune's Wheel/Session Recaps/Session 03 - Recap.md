Clarion will inform the PCs about Eliath, the missing man that his network is trying to spot in the Hive.
The only hint available to Clarion is that the murders happen predominantly in the Hive and he is sure to happen again tonight. The plan onwards is to keep one eye for any murder and the other for their own safety, since the Hive is a very dangerous place to roam about.
From here on, the [[Chapter I - The Hive||Chapter 1]] and [[Chapter II - The Mortuary||Chapter 2]] take place in order. 

Progressing from Session 3, the characters tracked down the murders in the Hive, while accustoming themselves warmly with Clarion.
The party met with the Dancing Man once, the Collectors, the Bleakers and Shadowknave, which escaped. All according to plan. Shadowknave's two hirelings were interrogated thoroughly and spitted out everything they knew. 
**The only lead now is the Mortuary, to meet Toranna and ask about Eliath's body.**

Shadowknave plans to sent an assassination elite team a couple of nights later to finish of the PCs. If the PCs manage to get to the bottom of this by the next session, on their first travel to the Mortuary, then Shadowknave will have probably failed to stop the PCs and probably resign completely from this mission. However, if the characters just visit the Mortuary and head back to get a rest's night, Shadowknave will attack.
Toranna would manipulatively manage to learn the location of the tavern the characters rest, allegedly to inform them about Eliath if she finds anything of value, and will later on sent Shadowknave to murder them at night.
This time, Shadowknave won't wire any mere Hireling, but someone or something with a murder intend.
