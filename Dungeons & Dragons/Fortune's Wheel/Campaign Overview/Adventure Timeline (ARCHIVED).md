### Prelude: The End is Merely the Beginning

- After the last Great Modron March, Shemeshka the Marauder stumbled upon a modron contingent in Tyrant’s Spiral. Recognizing an opportunity, she devised a cunning plan to instigate a cosmic war between Mechanus and Limbo. By controlling the arms trade for both sides, Shemeshka aimed to profit immensely. To set her plan in motion, she began exposing the modrons to chaotic and fiendish influences, leveraging her deep connections in the Blood War trade.
- As the PCs delved into Shemeshka’s illicit operations, they caught wind of her manipulations. During their investigations, they rescued Josbert, a captive of Shemeshka’s goons. Unbeknownst to the PCs, this apparent rescue was orchestrated by Shemeshka herself, intending to plant Josbert as a spy within their ranks. This ploy allowed her to uncover the location of their safe house.
- The PCs eventually tracked the corrupted modrons to Gzemnid’s realm. However, their efforts were thwarted by Shemeshka’s machinations, aided by Farrow’s betrayal and Josbert’s unwitting espionage. The PCs met their demise, and Josbert’s memory was wiped clean of the events. Despite their defeat, one PC discovered a way to exploit a glitch in the timestream, leading to an unexpected twist in their fate.
- As they perished, the PCs experienced flashes of future events, likely from alternate timelines. These visions, deeply intertwined with their backstories, hinted at a deeper consequence of the timestream glitch. Unknown to them, these glimpses were residual information leaking into their consciousness, a byproduct of the glitch.
- Harnessing the power of belief, a particularly persuasive PC, with the help of R04M, a monodrone, convinced a small group of modrons that they were not truly capable of dying, only being defeated. R04M became pivotal in the unfolding events, surviving Shemeshka’s plots and ultimately being captured by her.
- Following the PCs’ deaths, Shemeshka ransacked their safe house to eliminate any evidence of her crimes. Meanwhile, the PCs respawned at 3rd level in the Mortuary, their memories erased. The modrons’ perception of the PCs as weaker due to their defeat contributed to this downgrade. These modrons, unreliable narrators themselves, were at the heart of the confusion and chaos that ensued.
### Act 1: Awakening and Escape

- The characters awaken in the Mortuary of Sigil with amnesia, recalling only a tragic event from their pasts. Their awakening is the result of the glitch caused by their failed initial attempt to solve the modron issue.
- They are drawn into Shemeshka’s web, initially unaware of her role in their past and the multiverse’s destabilization. Shemeshka is also unaware of their reincarnation, but not for long. In Sigil, information spreads quickly.
- The PCs explore Sigil, encountering various uneventful occurrences as they begin to piece together their surroundings. The short encounters of [[A Major Issue]] and/or [[Through Hell and Back]] can be played out to make the world feel dynamic and the glitch’s consequences real, but they won’t yet feel connected to these events.

### Act 1.2: The Eternal Boundary

- Run a modified version of Eternal Boundary. Easy way to explore Sigil as many barmies from the Hive mysteriously vanish, dying and coming back from the dead. This will alert the PCs about their condition, only to find out that theirs's is quite different. 
- Due to their condition not being verified as different from that of the barmies from the Hive, the Harmonium won't directly target them yet.
- When they resolve this, Hardheads and Guvners are now sure that they've committed a crime against the time continuum, therefore they will progress towards their arrest on Act 2.  
### Act 2: Discovery and the Parchment

- After a couple of days of resting in Sigil, the [[Chapter I.I - Arrest them!]] event takes place. The PCs are pursued by the Harmonium but receive unexpected help from Josbert, who aids in their escape and leads them to their safehouse in Undersigil. However, the safehouse has already been raided by Shemeshka.
- At the raided safehouse, the PCs find a razorvine chip, which serves as a ticket to the casino, pointing them to the Fortune’s Wheel. They decide to investigate the casino, engaging in various activities while seeking clues.
- Amidst the chaos that erupts in the casino, potentially orchestrated by Shemeshka or an unknown external force, R04M takes the opportunity to escape. During the turmoil, R04M discreetly passes a parchment to the PCs. The parchment contains coordinates to a portal in the Outlands and a cryptic message hinting at their shared history: 
	- Friends, loop detected. We meet again. I am. Happy? Locate: Walking Castle. Coordinates: [45.12, -30.56], [50.67, -25.43], [55.78, -20.89]. Objective: Restore harmony. Remember: R04M is a friend!

### Act 3.1: Affair on the Concordant Express

- Adia has asked the character and his allies to rally a  breakout  of a certain individual, member of the Hands of Havoc, that is being transported to the gate-town of Automata, to stand trial for theft and other serious accusations, via the Concordant Express.
- Since the departure of the train has a fixed date, this adventure cannot be railroaded as much. The characters have only one chance in boarding onto the train. Once the date passes, members off the Hands of Havoc that are already boarded on the train will try to free the prisoner and make an escape, which will prove futile as Hardheads will arrest them. Adia would then probably seek revenge, as she entrusted a precious and hard to acquire ticket for the Concordant Express, only to be deceived.
- If they board onto the train, the escape attempt can be achieved at a random location on the Outlands or close to where the castle might be. That would conclude this sub-act 3.1 and tie well with the next sub-act 3.2.

### Act 3.2: The Journey to the Walking Castle

- The characters follow the coordinates to a Walking Castle in the Outlands, a mysterious and ever-moving fortress known for its elusive nature and the powerful entities it attracts.
- Upon arrival, they expect to find R04M and learn more about their connection to the glitch and their mission to repair it.

### Act 4: The Twist of Fate

- As the characters reach the designated meeting point, they witness R04M's kidnapping by unknown agents, presumably sent by Shemeshka, just moments before they can reunite.
- In the castle, they discover the Mimir, the device crucial to their quest. However, the joy of this discovery is overshadowed by R04M's abduction and the looming threat of Shemeshka's reach.

-> meeting with Reene (daughter of Renesnuprah) and bringing her to the Mausoleum

### Act 5: The Quest Deepens

- With the Mimir in hand but R04M taken, the characters are thrust into a deeper web of intrigue and danger. They must navigate the challenges of the Outlands, decode the Mimir's secrets, and plan a rescue for R04M.
- Their journey is fraught with alliances and betrayals, as they must discern friend from foe in a realm where Shemeshka's influence runs deep.

### Act 6: Confrontation and Revelation

- The quest to rescue R04M and repair the glitch leads to confrontations with Shemeshka's agents and other planar entities drawn by the unfolding cosmic disturbance.
- Each encounter and challenge unveils more about the characters' pasts, the nature of the glitch, and the delicate balance of the multiverse.

### Act 7: The Final Gambit

- Armed with newfound knowledge and allies, the characters prepare for a daring attempt to repair the glitch, rescue R04M, and confront Shemeshka. **[see below]
- The culmination of their efforts will determine the fate of the multiverse and their own destinies, as they strive to correct the cosmic imbalance they unwittingly contributed to.

### Epilogue: The Real Deal

- Getting X01 to Mechanus does not end the story however. The arch-nemesis of the story was looming over the characters for a very long time, waiting for the exact moment to strike. And he did, when Renesnuprah was busy with the cosmic interference of the PCs, Vecna made his move.
    
- With the dead body and the essence of an adult time dragon of Chronepsis and the aspect of Null (evil dragon that served Vecna in the past), Vecna would resume his past failed plan to conquer Sigil. The final battle will transpire outside of the Mausoleum of Chronepsis.
    
- Renee (daughter of Ren) would offer her assistance.
    
- Possible allies can also be Kas (run a mini adventure on the domains of dread where he strikes a bargain with the Mist to return only for this fight and then consume him entirely)
    
- Chronepsis can not offer his assistance in mortal affairs, however he holds his position, not granting Vecna the absolute control of the Mausoleum. If the characters do not stop Vecna, he will use the aspect of Chronepsis' brother, Null, to completely absorb the realm of Chronepsis.
    

  
  

The characters have run through this adventure once before, interacting with NPCs and reaching the modrons in Gzemnid's realm, and the use of a corrupted Mimir on X01 was the catalyst for the glitch.

  

The glitch, resulting from the corrupted Mimir's interaction with X01, essentially 'resets' the characters but leaves echoes of their previous journey. This anomaly in the fabric of reality causes:

- Temporal Echoes: The characters' actions and interactions from their first journey leave faint impressions on the timeline. These echoes manifest as déjà vu or hazy memories among the NPCs they previously encountered.
    
- Fuzzy Recognition: NPCs might not immediately recognize the characters but feel an inexplicable familiarity or affinity towards them, driven by the subconscious influence of their prior interactions. This could range from a sense of trust or camaraderie to an unexplained dislike or fear, depending on the nature of the original encounter.
    
- Altered Perceptions: The characters themselves might experience brief flashes of memory or familiarity with certain locations, objects, or individuals, hinting at their previous journey without providing clear context or details.
    

  
  

** Once the PCs have replaced all the corrupted data, they can head to the spire to meet R04M as was originally planned. The spire piece goes largely as written in the module, except that it probably makes more sense for Ascetelis to be Shemeshka's spy. She is a spymaster, after all, and it makes Ascentelis' actions make WAY more sense. She's having the PCs lead her to the modron because Shemeshka knows killing the PCs is pointless but the modron knows enough to be a real threat. As written, R04M has been captured by the Darkweaver. Once the PCs free it, it laments that it's searched and searched for the tunnel the modrons marched down that led them into the Tyrant's Spiral, but it cannot find it. Now the only one who can see the lost modrons is Shemeshka!

So, if Shemeshka is the only one who can get to them, they're going to have to either force her or convince her to assist them. This turns the second visit to Fortune's Wheel into a HEIST, which should be more interesting and fun. R04M gives them its platinum chip and the PCs have to sneak/disguise/bluff their way in to access the portals to various demiplanes that Shemeshka is hiding in her casino. Surely one of them will grant access to Tyrant's Spiral? They can explore and participate in the games exactly as written as long as they have a convincing disguise or cover story. R04M can tell the PCs that it's not sure how they can access Shemeshka's chambers, but it DOES know anyone suspected of cheating at the games in the platinum rooms gets dragged off to a Different Place, and regular patrons never seem to enter or exit that place. It has never actually been to Fortune's End, so all its information is extrapolated from what it was able to overhear during its time as Shemeshka's captive. It can't advise them about any traps or dangers in Fortune's End or beyond - it can only give them the platinum chip to enter.

  
  

- How does Shemeshka find out about the characters, since she cannot recall their existence at all?
    

- The Aftermath of the Escape
    
- Mortuary Records: The discovery of blank death certificates by the Dustmen (Dusters) raises alarms. In a place like Sigil, where the unusual is commonplace, such an anomaly would indeed attract attention, especially when it suggests a disruption in the natural order of life and death.
    
- Factional Interest: The Guvners, with their obsession for laws and order, would see this anomaly as a potential threat or a puzzle to be solved, further spreading the word among the factions of Sigil. The Harmonium, with their mandate to enforce order and their view on cosmic law, would see the characters' resurrection as a violation needing correction.
    
- Shemeshka's Intervention
    
- Gathering Intelligence: Shemeshka, with her extensive network of spies and informants within all major factions, is positioned perfectly to intercept this information. Her interest could be piqued not just by the anomaly itself but by the potential leverage and power such unique individuals could offer her schemes.
    
- Preemptive Invitation: Recognizing the opportunity, Shemeshka acts swiftly to extend an invitation to the characters, drawing them into her casino before the Harmonium can mobilize. This invitation could be framed as an offer of protection or asylum, appealing to the characters' immediate need for safety and information.
    
- The Casino Encounter
    
- A Haven in the Storm: Upon their arrival, Shemeshka's casino offers the characters a respite from the brewing storm outside. Here, Shemeshka can present herself as a benefactor, using the situation to bind the characters into a debt of gratitude or a sense of obligation.
    
- Layered Agendas: While offering sanctuary, Shemeshka would seek to understand the nature of the characters' resurrection and the glitch. Her interactions with them could range from cordial hospitality to subtle manipulation, aiming to uncover their secrets while keeping her true intentions veiled.
