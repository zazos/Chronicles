***Location:** Outlands/Wandering Burg*

![[castra_deposita.png]]

In the Outlands, there’s a burg that’s more of a moving fortress than a place to call kip. Castra Deposita, they call it, the Stricken Camp. It ain’t like any burg you’ve seen before. This place roams the Outlands like a hungry wolf, always on the prowl, always searchin’ for burgs teetering on the edge of slippin’ from one plane to the next.

Now, who runs this gritty camp? It’s the **Doomguard**, of course cutter. That bunch of fatalists who see beauty in decay and reckon that helpin’ shift the terrain will erode the boundaries of the Outer Planes a little bit more. They believe in entropy, see, the slow crumble and decay of everything. To them, helpin’ a place slide from one plane to another is like givin’ the Multiverse a gentle nudge towards its inevitable end. 

The camp itself is a sight—tents, wagons, and structures all rigged for travel and toughness. No fluff, no finery, just stark functionality. The Doomguard, they live and breathe their mission. In every rusty iron spike and every taut (if fraying) rope, you can see their commitment to the cause of spreading entropy.

And the atmosphere? It’s heavy, cutter. Dark and intense, like a storm cloud ready to burst. You walk through Castra Deposita, and you can feel the weight of its purpose. It’s a gritty camp driven by a philosophy as old and relentless as time—the slow, sure march towards decay and destruction.
