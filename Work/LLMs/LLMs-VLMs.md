# LLM/VLM Key Terminology: Explanations and Guidance

Below you will find structured, nuanced explanations for each key concept, with important terms and guidance highlighted for clarity and learning focus.

## **A. Tokenization**

## 1. Task Description

Tokenization is the initial step in processing text for Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It involves _breaking down_ raw input (such as sentences or documents) into **tokens**, which are manageable units like subwords, words, or symbols.

## 2. Methodology / Principles

Tokenization leverages algorithms to segment text according to _linguistic rules_ or _statistical patterns_. Common strategies include **byte-pair encoding (BPE)** and **WordPiece**. The goal is to represent any possible input using a fixed vocabulary of tokens while balancing efficiency and comprehensiveness.

## 3. Inputs and Outputs

- **Inputs:** Raw text or media description.
    
- **Outputs:** A list/sequence of tokens (numerical IDs or subword pieces).
    

## 4. Use Cases / Applications

- Preprocessing for language models
    
- Converting speech/audio or text to token IDs before feeding into models
    
- Alignment of text regions with image or video features in VLMs
    

## 5. Benefits & Advantages

- Enables **consistent model input**
    
- Facilitates _handling of out-of-vocabulary (OOV)_ words via subword units
    
- Reduces data sparsity
    

## 6. Limitations & Challenges

- Can fragment words unnaturally in rare languages or domains
    
- Token boundaries may lose semantic information
    
- May introduce _alignment errors_ when linking text and vision features
    

## 7. Illustrative Example (Plain Text)

A sentence like "unbelievable" might be split into ["un", "believ", "able"], allowing the model to handle unknown words by combining known subparts.

## **B. Prompt Engineering**

## 1. Task Description

Prompt engineering is the _art and science_ of designing and optimizing input prompts to elicit desired outputs from LLMs or VLMs.

## 2. Methodology / Principles

This involves strategically _structuring, phrasing,_ and sometimes _chaining_ prompts. Techniques include **zero-shot**, **few-shot**, and **chain-of-thought prompting** to guide models toward specific reasoning paths.

## 3. Inputs and Outputs

- **Inputs:** User-crafted prompt text, possibly with examples or context
    
- **Outputs:** Model responses, completions, or actions relevant to the prompt
    

## 4. Use Cases / Applications

- Creating chatbots or task-oriented assistants
    
- Developing language-driven agents for summarization, translation, or reasoning
    
- Testing and _debugging_ model performance
    

## 5. Benefits & Advantages

- Enhances **model usefulness without retraining**
    
- Allows for rapid prototyping and adjustment
    
- Can unlock model capabilities for new tasks
    

## 6. Limitations & Challenges

- Highly sensitive to subtle changes; crafting effective prompts can require significant _trial and error_
    
- Lack of _formal guarantees_ on reliability or output quality
    
- May expose model biases
    

## 7. Illustrative Example (Plain Text)

Asking an LLM, "Summarize the following article in two sentences," versus, "What are the main points of this article?" can produce notably different results.

## **C. Fine-Tuning**

## 1. Task Description

Fine-tuning is the process of _adapting_ a pre-trained foundation model to a specialized task by retraining on targeted data.

## 2. Methodology / Principles

Builds on **transfer learning** principles: start with a base model trained on large general data, then train further using _task-specific_ datasets. Adjusts model weights to optimize for the new objective.

## 3. Inputs and Outputs

- **Inputs:** Pre-trained model, specialized labeled dataset
    
- **Outputs:** Task-adapted version of the model
    

## 4. Use Cases / Applications

- Domain-specific chatbots (healthcare, legal)
    
- Custom summarizers or sentiment analyzers
    
- Multimodal models tuned for specific visual tasks
    

## 5. Benefits & Advantages

- Delivers **higher accuracy** on custom tasks
    
- Leverages enormous general knowledge
    
- Reduces data and computation needs compared to training from scratch
    

## 6. Limitations & Challenges

- Requires sufficient labeled data for target task
    
- Potential for **catastrophic forgetting** (loss of original capabilities)
    
- May raise legal or ethical concerns around data usage
    

## 7. Illustrative Example (Plain Text)

A base English-language LLM is fine-tuned on medical records to answer questions about diseases with improved accuracy for healthcare professionals.

## **D. Quantization**

## 1. Task Description

Quantization refers to _reducing the numerical precision_ of a modelâ€™s weights and activations, significantly shrinking model size and improving efficiency.
