We bring proven expertise in decentralized federated learning for LLMs, offering unique combination of proprietary technology and large-scale implementation experience.

**Our Core Expertise:**

- **FEDRA P2P Protocol**

- Enables direct, peer-to-peer model-update exchange between edge nodes.
- Eliminates the need for a central aggregator, significantly enhancing privacy and scalability.

- **Flower Framework Integration**

- Demonstrated success in large-scale federated LLM fine-tuning, as seen in our FlowerTune LLM initiative.

- **Dual-Objective Innovation**

- A novel approach that combines next-token prediction with explanation fidelity.
- Delivers transparent and privacy-compliant AI by design.

As a federated learning technology innovator, we will focus on:

1. **Enhancing FluidifAI’s federated training pillar**

2. We will integrate our **FEDRA P2P** protocol to enable truly decentralized LLM training across the edge-cloud continuum.
3. We will extend the **Flower’s framework** capabilities for large-scale LLM fine-tuning in highly distributed environments.

4. **Bridging Transparency and Explainability**

5. We will implement dual-objective optimization to build LLM explainability directly into the model via auxiliary heads.
6. We will ensure the secure aggregation of explanation parameters, guaranteeing that no raw data is ever exposed.

7. **Cross-pillar optimization**

8. We will adapt federated methods to support FluidifAI’s _distributed AI apps_ pillar, enabling features like dynamic model updates at the edge.


**Our Unique Value:**

The combination of our FEDRA protocol and Flower integration solves FluidifAI’s central challenge of achieving scalable, policy-compliant AI training across heterogeneous infrastructures.

1. **FEDRA-Flower Integration**

2. Develop middleware to deploy FEDRA’s P2P communication atop Flower’s federated framework.
3. Enable secure parameter exchange for LLM training across edge-cloud continuum.

4. **Explainability module**

5. Implement dual-loss training for auxiliary explanation heads (e.g. self-attention visualizers, counterfactual generators)
6. Design methods for securely combining explanation parameters while remaining encrypted.

7. **FluidifAI orchestration**

8. Integrated with FluidifAI’s transparent computing continuum for dynamic resource allocation during federated rounds.

**Validation & Use Cases**

- **Healthcare:** Explainable symptom prioritization in hospital IoT networks without exposing raw patient data.
- **Smart Factory:** Quality assurance (QA) systems with fully auditable decision trails.

**Synergy with FluidifAI**

This activity directly advances Pillar 1 (federated model training), supports Pillar 2 (distributed AI apps) and addressed the project’s core transparency requirements with verifiable AI decisions at the edge.
