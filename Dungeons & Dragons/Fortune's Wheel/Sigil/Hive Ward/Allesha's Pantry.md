Location: Sigil / Clerks’ Ward / Workman’s Avenue, near the edge

If you’re ever wandering too close to the Slags (and really, I’d suggest you rethink that decision), you might stumble across Allesha’s Pantry, a beacon of hope in the Hive Ward’s unending grey misery. You can’t miss it: an old workhouse dressed up with whatever cheer Allesha Sheavis (planar human fighter [she/her] / Free League / LG) could scrape together, standing defiantly against the choking gloom. The exterior might look like it’s seen better centuries—brickwork crumbling like a Styx swimmer’s memories—but the windows shine bright, with cheerful signs proclaiming (in many alphabets): “A full stomach lifts the spirit” and “Everyone basher is welcome here.”

Step inside, and you’ll find the place bustling with life—or, well, as much life as you can muster from the Hive’s downtrodden sods. The interior’s surprisingly welcoming, like a warm hug from a long-lost friend. Colourful posters plaster the walls, some bearing uplifting slogans, others with drawings of suns, trees, or other wonders that don’t exist in this grim corner of the multiverse. Allesha’s little touches of hope are paper-thin barriers against the Hive’s pervasive gloom, but sometimes, even the faintest light can make a difference. The air smells of fresh bread and warm soup, and if you close your eyes, you might even forget that you’re in one of the worst parts of the Cage. For a moment, until you open them again…

Clusters of paper strips, shaped and folded like flower bouquets, adorn the tables. The patrons sit around **steaming pots of tomato soup** and **pigeon stew**, sharing tales or singing songs that poke fun at the “delicacies” Allesha serves. “The stew’s so thin,” one regular cackled, “that even a hungry tanar’ri wouldn’t bother possessing it!” Allesha just laughs along and sometimes joins in the singing, her bright voice echoing through the hall, lifting spirits even as it lifts spoons.


#### Allesha: The Do-Gooder’s Do-Gooder

Allesha Sheavis herself is a sight to behold. A human with a shaved head gleaming like polished bronze and a golden ring glinting in her long nose, she’s as fierce as they come. Born into privilege in the Clerk’s Ward, Allesha abandoned her wealth—and the Fated—when she discovered the vile truth about her father’s fortune: rent profits squeezed from the Hive’s poorest. With her inheritance, she vowed to right his wrongs, and even after the money ran out, she never abandoned her mission. These days, she hustles as a tout, a bounty hunter, or a freelance troubleshooter to keep her kitchen running, though she’d sooner eat a barbed devil’s tail than work with the Takers.

Her fire’s dimmed a little since her younger sister Neevie died—ripped apart by the **Kadyx**, the beast that stalks the Slags—but Allesha’s iron will hasn’t broken. The locals still call her a hero, and she keeps fighting for them, even if her smiles come a little less freely these days.

#### The Pantry’s System

While Allesha’s Pantry doesn’t charge for food, there’s a small catch. Allesha asks her guests to pitch in an hour or two of work: baking bread, stirring tea, or scrubbing floors. Bashers who lend a hand earn the right to sleep inside—though “sleeping inside” means laying on the floor unless you cough up a copper for a proper bed. Don’t scoff; these aren’t your average flea-ridden cots. Allesha keeps the mattresses and sheepskin sheets clean by baking them in the giant brick ovens, a method she swears by for staying vermin-free.

Oh, and mind this: never badmouth the Free League in her presence. It’s no secret that Allesha despises most of the other factions, but she holds the Takers in special contempt. The last berk who tried preaching about the “glory of self-sufficiency” got a faceful of flour and a lecture so scathing that I swear a Headhead patrol could have arrested her for verbal violence. The joke of course being that no Hardheads every come to this part of the Cage.

So, if you’re ever lost and hungry in the Hive, wander over to Allesha’s. You’ll find food, a place to rest, and perhaps even a flicker of hope. But keep your wits about you—compassion doesn’t change the fact that you’re still in one of Sigil’s roughest quarters. Watch your back, keep your coin hidden, and pitch in to lend a hand in the kitchen. A little honest work won’t kill you.

**Allesha’s Pantry  
**—  
**Breakfast**  
Sootbread Toast with Scraps Jam  
_Yesterday’s bread revived with a touch of toasting and smeared with a questionable fruit spread, heavy on the mystery berries._    
Hard-Tack Porridge  
_Oats boiled to near-paste, sometimes featuring sweeteners like molasses or honey (if Allesha’s been lucky that week)._    
Mystery Egg Medley  
_A scrambled mess of “eggs” (source unspecified, but often avian) spiced with leftover herbs. Good luck guessing what kind they are today._    
—  
**Lunch**  
Pigeon Stew with Wilted Greens  
_Tender bits of pigeon and barely identifiable greens floating in a thin, tomato-based broth. Comes with a side of stale crackers._  
Tomato Soup Surprise  
_A generous pot of watery tomato soup, sometimes thickened with yesterday’s leftover porridge. The “surprise” is some days it might actually have flavour._  
Panfried Rat & Root Hash  
_Seared rodent meat diced and mixed with tough root vegetables. Surprisingly hearty, if you don’t mind knowing the main ingredient squeaked its last just hours earlier._    
—  
**Extras (if you’re lucky)** Twice-Baked Crusties  
_Hard bread slices baked again to crunchy perfection. Perfect for dipping or using as a makeshift weapon._    
Pickled Slum Cabbage  
_A sharp, sour side dish fermented with vinegar and hope. Keeps the stomach occupied, if not happy._    
—  
**Drinks**  
Vegetable Scraps Tea  
_Hot and earthy, with a suspiciously orange hue. Unlimited refills, because even Allesha can’t pawn off that much of it._    
Herb-Infused Water  
_Boiled water steeped with whatever herbs are handy. Refreshing, with a side of “what’s-that-taste?” curiosity._    
—  
**Dessert**  
Candied Squiggle Fruit (Seasonal)  
_Sticky chunks of something sweet, caramelised to disguise whatever it once was. Often a hit with the local street urchins._  
  
Subject to change based on availability, whims of the Hive, and the occasional generous donation from a bashful merchant.  
_Note: Complaints about the menu (unless as part of a jolly song) will earn you a stern glare and a lecture from Allesha. Remember, beggars can’t be choosers—or gourmets._
