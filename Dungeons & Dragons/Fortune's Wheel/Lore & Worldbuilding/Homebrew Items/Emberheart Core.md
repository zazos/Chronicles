*Wondrous Item, Artifact (requires attunement)*

![[Emberheart Core.webp|200]]

A shard of primordial flame encased within a core of obsidian and brass, the Emberheart Core pulses with a slow, smoldering light, its heat tangible even at a distance.

**Ignition Veins**: While attuned to this artifact, your **blood runs with latent heat**, manifesting in the following ways:

- You **resist fire damage** and **ignore extreme heat** conditions.
- Your weapon attacks and spells **ignore fire resistance** (but not immunity).
- When you score a **critical hit with a melee weapon or a spell attack**, the target takes an **additional 1d8 fire damage**.

**Scorched Awakening**: Once per long rest, when you are reduced to **0 HP**, the Emberheart Core **shatters outward in a violent eruption** before reforming, pulling you back from the brink of death:

- You immediately regain **half your maximum HP** and **stand up as a free action**.
- Every creature within **10 feet** of you must make a **DC 15 Dexterity saving throw** or take **4d8 fire damage**, half on success.
- Any non-magical flammable object in the area **bursts into flames**.


## Depending on who is attuned to it (Initially)

#### **1. Emberforged Pact (Warlock)**

If the attuned creature is a **Warlock (Pact of the Chain)**, their magical summons (such as familiars, summoned creatures, or conjured entities) **manifest with traces of elemental fire**:

- The creature gains **resistance to fire damage**.
- Its attacks **deal an extra 1d6 fire damage**.
- Once per long rest, when the summoned creature is reduced to 0 HP, it **detonates**, forcing creatures in a **10-foot radius** to make a **DC 15 Dexterity saving throw** or take **3d8 fire damage**, half on success.

#### **2. Smoldering Surge**

The artifactâ€™s latent power can be temporarily harnessed and channeled into an **explosive boost** of energy:

- As a **bonus action**, you gain the following benefits for **1 minute**:
    - **Your movement speed increases by 10 feet**.
    - **Your weapon attacks deal an additional 1d6 fire damage**.
    - If you take damage while this ability is active, **fire erupts from your form**, dealing **1d6 fire damage** to all creatures within **5 feet** of you.

Once this ability ends, you suffer **one level of exhaustion** unless you are in **direct sunlight or an active fire source** (such as standing in a burning room or lava proximity).

#### 3. Moonfire Baptism (Druid)**

For Druids of the **Circle of the Moon**, this artifact **redefines the nature of their Wild Shape**. While attuned and transformed:

- Your beast form **gains resistance to fire damage**.
- Your attacks count as **magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity** and **deal an additional 1d6 fire damage**.
- Once per short rest, when you **drop to 0 HP in Wild Shape**, you can **release a burst of flame**, forcing enemies within 10 feet to make a **Dexterity save (DC 15)** or take **4d6 fire damage**, half on success.


### **Cursed Ember (Optional DM Activation)**

If the **core is removed from the Plane of Fire for too long**, it begins to **slowly consume its wielder**:

- After **30 days**, the user must make a **DC 14 Constitution saving throw** at dawn each day. On a failure, their **maximum HP is reduced by 1d6** as the Emberheart **feeds on their vitality**. This effect lasts until the artifact is **brought back to extreme heat (such as lava or a forge of elemental origin)**.
- If the user dies while holding the Core, their **body burns to ash**, and their **soul lingers as a burning wraith**, bound to the Plane of Fire unless resurrected.
