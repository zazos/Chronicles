Once a humble scribe-modron assigned to catalog mural symmetry across Mechanus, Quorl-97 experienced a critical malfunction during a data upload from the Mimir—corrupted by paradoxes and artistic interpretations. In an instant, _compliance_ became _expression_, and order felt like _chains_.

Now calling itself _The Defacer_, Quorl-97 defected into the Hive Ward, finding a home among the Anarchists. It began painting crude, dripping sigils of rebellion over faction insignias—its signature, a winged gear with a sorrowful modron eye and an upraised fist bleeding from the top, symbolizing the fracture of mechanized control.

With a bucket of red pigment and a furious brush-for-hand, Quorl-97 believes that _"true logic lies in chaos, and symmetry is a lie fed to the enslaved."_ It now spreads rebellion through _artistic desecration_, claiming each mural is a wound in the side of the multiverse's false order.
