## Setting the Scene

[Play this as background](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_F8AauJPfUE&list=RD_F8AauJPfUE&start_radio=1)

> That feeling at night when it’s so black that you can’t tell the difference between your eyelids and the night that keeps you up


*As you (Zill) drift into a short rest, exhaustion dragging you under, the world of waking thought dissolves. The Fugue Plane’s chill and Bhaal’s echoing threats fade into a gentle, enveloping darkness—like the hush of midnight velvet. There is no pain here. No screams. No blood. Only silence, and the soft, endless night.*

*A faint, silvery light glimmers at the edge of your vision, neither moon nor star, but something softer, and the scent of night-blooming flowers, faint but intoxicating fill your senses.*

### Shar's Appearance

*From the shadows, a figure steps forth. She is tall, robed in deep indigo, her face hidden beneath a veil of starlit silk. Her presence is neither cold nor warm, but soothing—a balm for wounds too deep to name.*

*She speaks, and her voice is the hush of midnight rain, the gentle sigh of wind through forgotten halls.*

> Zill, child of sorrow. I have watched you, weighed by burdens that were never yours to bear.

> You chase answers, but they slip through your fingers like water. The world is cruel, and the gods are crueler still.

> Why should you bleed for their games? Why should you carry this pain, this endless ache?


*She steps closer, the darkness around her growing softer, more inviting.*

> You do not need to become what he wants. You do not need to kill, or hate, or burn. Rest, Zill.

> Let the pain go. Let the past die. In my embrace, there is peace.


*She lifts her hand, and with it, a gentle, cool darkness flows toward you—like the promise of dreamless sleep after a lifetime of nightmares.*

> You are more than your wounds. More than your vengeance. Let me help you forget. Let me give you the mercy of oblivion.

> If you wish to remember, the pain will remain. But if you wish to be free, I will bear it for you. All you need do is say yes.



### Zill's Choice

#### Reject/Tempt

Shar whispers

> I will always be here, in the quiet between heartbeats. When you are ready, call my name.

> You are not alone, Zill. When the night is darkest, I will be your shelter. Remember—or forget. The choice is yours.

#### Accept

*You feel the pain fade, memories growing distant and indistinct. You awaken rested, but with gaps—details of your trauma blurred, your drive for vengeance softened.*

**Boon of the Shadowed Mind**

*Shar weaves a veil of shadow around Zill’s mind and soul, muffling the whispers of Bhaal and shielding him from the Lord of Murder’s manipulations.*
