*Who Believe Everyone is Already Dead*

![[FactionHeraldsofDust5e.webp | 300]]

**Factol**: Skall

**Headquarters**: Mortuary

**Aligned Plane**: Hades

**Members**: Corpse collectors, the grief stricken, Undead

**Epithet**: Dusters

The Heralds of Dust believe the multiverse itself is an afterlife—a shadow of some other existence now gone—and every creature is already dead. The “life” that beings cling to is simply the first stage of death.

Dusters seek to understand and experience the stages of death, the last of which they hold is True Death: a transcendence to a state of being beyond the multiverse. In their quest for True Death, the Heralds of Dust slowly set aside the hope and passion that chain a soul to this false life.

The Heralds of Dust have a macabre fascination with Undead. They believe undeath is a precursor to True Death and count many Undead among their ranks. Skeletons and zombies serve the faction in droves, and sapient Undead—such as ghosts, vampires, and liches—rise to factotums.

Factol Skall (neutral evil lich) is the oldest factol in Sigil. The founder of the Heralds of Dust, Skall has yet to transcend his current existence, lingering to guide as many souls as possible along the path to True Death. Skall strives to know everything and feel nothing. He makes generous use of adventurers to gather knowledge or help lay the dead to rest with dignity.

**Faction Attire**. Dusters dress in grim clothes associated with the work of the dead. An individual member might be mistaken for—or actually be—a gravedigger, a mortician, or a ghoul in tattered rags.

**Role in Sigil**. Part morgue, funeral home, and tomb, the Mortuary is the destination for Sigil’s dead. There, the Heralds of Dust count the Bleak Cabal and the Doomguard as allies. Conversely, the Mind’s Eye bristles at the Dusters’ fatalistic dismissal of life, and the Society of Sensation viscerally opposes their rejection of passion.

## To Die, Perchance to Dream

A more morbid philosophy you’ll not find this side of the **Gray Waste**, cutter. The **Dustmen** believe that the inhabitants of the Multiverse are already dead. Some are more dead than others, perhaps, but even the living are actually dead. “If this existence was whole the point of life, then someone’s got their sums wrong”, as **Qaida** once said. Some Dustmen reckon that this stage of the great cycle—that which most cutters view as ‘life’—is in fact a low point. Maybe that’s why they’re so sodding miserable all the time.

Presumably, after a body passes through this particular phase it’ll emerge into “life”, as the Dustmen would understand it. “So why don’t the Dead just up and hang themselves from the leafless tree”, you might well be asking, “It’s not like we’ll miss the depressing sods”.

Well, the Dustmen would take issue with this. You can’t just put yourself in the Dead-Book or let someone else do it for you; that’s like trying to cheat the Multiverse. No, you’ve got to live your “life” and die naturally, or you’ll be recycled and made to do it all again. And as for them being depressing; that’s the Dustmen trying to move themselves closer to the state of True Death (as they call it) by shedding their emotions, the last semblance of life.

And if you’ve ever had to share a drink with one of the Dead, you’ll know full well just how good at it they can be…
