**Scene: The Unfolding Paradox in Tyrant's Spiral**

In a dark chamber, where gases leaked from hole and geometrically shaped creatures moved ceaselessly in an endless loop,, time-space hazily danced around Eldic. He was standing on the precipice of a cosmic confluence.

Before him lay an impossible scene: a sea of cubic, spherical and more complex polyhedral creatures, each mechanical entity locked in an intricate dance of gears and cogs, their synchronized movements producing a mesmerizing, mechanical hum that reverberated throughout the chamber. The spiraling mass of these creatures seemed both endless and eternal, an ordered march.

Eldric was not alone in this cosmic theater. Four other figures, shrouded in shadow and obscured by the play of light and time, stood beside him. Their features were hidden, their presence familiar.

In Eldric's hands, a strange device pulsed with a rhythm that resonated with the heartbeat of creation itself. Tick-tack.
The device seemed to unite the concept of magic and technology, a conduit for forces beyond mortal comprehension. Arcane symbols danced across its surface, weaving patterns of unfathomable mathematic significance.

The tension in the air was felt, a reflection of the cosmic weight of the moment. Eldric could feel the eyes of the multiverse upon him, as if the fate of all things hung in the balance. The swirling energies of time and space swirled around the device, intertwining with the essence of the modrons.

Eldic gulped, the memory of Elara nodding was imprinted in his mind. But, she wasn't alone at that moment, there was someone else beside her, holding her by the shoulder lovingly. If only he could remember his facial features, but this wasn't the time. Right, there was no time present.  

As Eldric activated the device, a blinding surge of energy erupted, its brilliance piercing the boundaries of understanding. The paradox unfurled before them, and the very foundations of existence seemed to shudder. 

"Let it be known, Eldic. That was a mistake. But not yours", whose voice was that? He couldn't remember.
