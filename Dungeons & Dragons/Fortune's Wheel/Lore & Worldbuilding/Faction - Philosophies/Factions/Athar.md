**Epithet**: Defiers
## What do the Athar Believe?

The Athar believe that the gods are impostors. For all their might, the so-called deities are merely mortals who have accumulated enough power to convince the rest of the multiverse otherwise. With enough time, talent, and dedication, anyone could ascend to godhood.

Defiers accept that there might be true deities that oversee everything, but such beings are beyond comprehension. They assert that worshipers of the gods draw their power from unknowable sources—false gods simply take the credit.

The Athar aren’t fools. They let the powers that be call themselves gods, while the faction works subtly to discover the secret behind the curtain of the multiverse and look on the unknowable.

The Athar are led by Factol Terrance (neutral good, human Athar null). While many Defiers become bitter, Terrance remains compassionate, pointing wayward souls toward truth like a friendly guide—a guardian and shepherd of priests who fall from their previous devotions.

Terrance reveres an entity known as the Greater Unknown, which he believes is the source of all divine power.

**Faction Attire**. Defiers wear geometric, starry fabrics that hint at their astral ties. They adorn their outfits with silver chains and broken holy symbols.

**Role in Sigil.** The Athar gather in the Shattered Temple, a place once dedicated to Aoskar, a now-dead god of portals. Rather than serve in Sigil’s government, the Athar’s self-appointed spy network closely surveils the city’s faiths. When a temple pushes a god’s influence too strongly, the Athar either deal with the problem themselves or leak the information to a faction that will, such as the Harmonium. The Athar regard members of the Mind’s Eye as allies.

## **Believing in Disbelief**

The latest in a long line of Athar rhetorical speeches has proved a great success with Cagers. Always looking for a new metaphor to use to bring the powers down a peg or three, **Denzith Ab Plarok** _(Prime human 0-level [he/him] / Athar / CG)_ says that if a power is considered to be a human, then his proxies would be dogs – basically faithful, obedient, dumb, drooling slaves. Priests would be rats – sly and after as many crumbs of the human’s food as possible. At the bottom of the heap, as always, are normal bashers, who’d be the equivalent of mice – vulnerable to abuse from any of the others. All the more reason why, argues Denzith, we don’t let the powers get exactly what they want: Worship!

In another of his increasingly influential speeches, Denzith mocked one of the favourite claims of priests: That humans are the finest creations of the gods. If this is the case, Denzith argued, then these so-called powers ain’t exactly fine craftsmen, are they!

I’ve collected several more examples of the philosophies filtering out of the faction at present, and offer them as freely as the faction Denies the Gods.

## The Athar And Alignment

Athar factioneers can be of any alignment. Here are some suggestions of how the philosophy might morph depending on the moral and ethical outlook of the faction member:

**Good-aligned characters:** They might see the Athar’s beliefs as a call to focus on doing good for its own sake, not for divine reward or because you’re told to. They could view some of the powers as examples to follow—or as examples of corrupt beings to _not_ follow, but certainly not as ultimate moral authorities.

**Lawful characters:** They could find the Athar’s philosophy challenging. The idea that the ultimate power is unknowable might clash with a fundamental need for order and structure. However, they might also see it as a call to find order in themselves rather than relying on external divine order to tell them what the rules are.

**Chaotic characters:** They’d likely be drawn to the Athar’s rejection of traditional divine authority. This aligns with a love of freedom and disdain for imposed order. The idea of an unknowable truth could be seen as the ultimate expression of the chaotic mystery of existence.

**Neutral characters:** These folks might find the Athar’s philosophy appealing due to its balanced view. It neither fully rejects the idea of higher powers nor fully accepts them. It’s a sort of philosophical middle ground that acknowledges the complexity and mystery of the universe.

**Evil characters:** These cutters might appreciate the Athar’s view as it frees them from divine moral constraints. They might use the idea of false gods to justify their own selfish or malevolent actions, believing that moral authority is a sham. If there are no morals, then there’s nothing to stop them doing whatever they want.

## Real-World Philosophical Parallels

The Athar’s philosophy centres around their rejection of the powers as false deities—they don’t deny that powers exist, but do dispute that they’re divine beings worthy of worship and veneration. In a multiverse where a blood can wield the arcane might of an archmage, or a tanar’ri can ascend to be an Abyssal Lord of an entire infinite layer of a plane, the so-called ‘powers’ are just one stage more advanced than this. Deciding that this kind of creature is a regular powerful cutter but _that_ kind is a deity…well, it’s arbitrary at best. The Athar argue that an actual god would be fundamentally unknowable, and none of the powers seem to fit that. Because of this, they reject the powers as frauds. 

There are several real-world philosophical and religious ideas that overlap with the beliefs of the Athar:

The most obvious parallel can be found in **atheism**—the absence of belief in the existence of deities, and **agnosticism**—the belief that the existence of deities is unknowable. The assertion that the powers are false gods aligns with the stance of atheists, and their notion of an incomprehensible divinity echos agnostic thought. 

Building on this line of thought, **deism** is the belief in a supreme creator who does not intervene in the multiverse after creating it. The Athar’s belief in the Great Unknown as an unknowable force echos deism, particularly the aspect of the creator being beyond the reach of mortals and their lack of direct involvement in things. **Gnosticism** takes this one stage further, emphasising the idea of an ultimate, transcendental reality that is beyond the material world or mortal understanding, and introduced mystical practises designed to interpret this. 

**Skepticism** is another important facet of the Athar way of thinking. This involves questioning and challenging the claims of truth and knowledge of the ‘religious’’, especially when it comes to the Athar denying the divinity of such endlessly powerful beings. The more militant members of the faction could also be called **iconoclasts**, which refers to the active destruction of religious artefacts and symbols, or more broadly a rejection of the established institutions of temples and organised religion.

Finally, aspects of Athar philosophy mesh with the ideas of **humanism**—although in the planes, perhaps ‘mortalism’ would be a better word. This emphasises the agency of people over inherited dogma, and leans towards critical thinking and forming views based on evidence rather than superstition. The insistence of the Athar on their own investigations rather than blindly swallowing the claims of the powers shares similarity with humanism.

Overall, the philosophy of the Athar is a blend of atheistic and agnostic skepticism, deistic notions of an unknowable supreme being, iconoclastic rejection of established religious powers, and a humanistic pursuit of truth. The faction attempts to question the very nature of divinity and its role in the multiverse, demanding evidence beyond the claims of those beings powerful enough to simply announce themselves as deities.
