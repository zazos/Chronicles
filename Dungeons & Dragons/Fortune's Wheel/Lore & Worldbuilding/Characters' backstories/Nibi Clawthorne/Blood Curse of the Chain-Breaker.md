**Effect:**  
When a creature marked by Nibi’s Blood Curse damages an ally within 15 ft of her, she may use her reaction to teleport to the creature and make a single melee weapon attack with advantage. If it hits, the target’s speed is reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn.

**Amplify:**  
If amplified, the target must also succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = Hemocraft save) or be restrained by spectral red chains for 1 round.

## Dreamlike Vision

> As your eyes lock onto your fallen ally—bleeding, broken—you feel the world tilt. Your pulse roars like thunder, drowning out battle cries.
> 
> Your eyes flutter, and suddenly the battlefield is gone. You're surrounded by endless dark, a suffocating gloom illuminated only by cold shafts of moonlight cutting through unseen bars. The air is heavy, oppressive, echoing with faint, weary growls - a sound of pain and fatigue.
> 
> Before you stands a massive white wolf, its fur matted and dirtied by time, captivity, and neglect. Pale eyes shimmer like ice, locked onto yours. This wolf does not stand proud; it hunches low, shackled by heavy, rusted chains bound cruelly around its limbs and neck.
> 
> The chains rattle softly with every laboured breath the creature takes, and it's voice comes strained, raw, scarcely more than a whisper.
> 
> "They fall... and yet you hold yourself back."


> 
> She shifts slightly, causing the chains to scrape loudly against the stone floor,
> 
> "You call me a curse," the wolf breathes, her voice shuddering with long-held pain. "But look closer—I am a prisoner, bound within you. We are chained. Both captives."
> 
> The wolf drags herself closer, every movement an agony, chains rattling louder
> "Break these chains," she growls softly, almost pleading, eyes blazing. "End our captivity. Accept this gift not as a burden - but as freedom."


> **Chains**—crimson and spectral—bind her limbs, coiled around your own wrists as well. Taut. Shaking. Waiting to snap.
> 
> One of the chains **shatters** - crimson fragments flying like embers into your chest. The wolf gasps and summons the strength to thrust the remaining chains towards you. 
>  
> "Take the chains..." she rasps, "and break free."
> 
> You instinctively grasp the chain mid-air, feeling it sear into your palm, branding you.


After combat ends—Nibi feels the **red mark still on her hand** where she grasped the chain.

> But the burning sensation remains, etched vividly on your hand—a scarlet emblem of defiance.
> 
> And in your ears lingers the whispering growl of the white wolf:
> 
> "We were bound... but now... we hunt together."
