## Who is Valkor?

%% <img src="Valkor Josbert.webp" class="rightimg" height=500> %%

Valkor “Josbert” Senren is a **changeling identity broker**, information fence, and mild con artist who maintains **a distinct persona in every major faction** of Sigil. He operates under pseudonyms—names that change with the mood of the city and the colors of his coat. Each faction believes he is a low-level, but dependable informant or fixer, rarely someone to interrogate or suspect.

In reality, Valkor is deeply loyal only to himself and his obscure philosophy: **"Fate leaves fingerprints."** His decisions follow hunches, patterns, gut-feelings—he calls it "reading the weave," though whether this is magical intuition or mere survival instinct is unclear.

## Valkor to Shemeshka

- Valkor is **a useful pawn with plausible deniability**.
- He feeds Shemeshka curated information from within factions, often without knowing the full value of what he delivers.
- Shemeshka respects his utility but keeps him at arm’s length.
- He was _originally hired by Shemeshka_, but their arrangement is unofficial, unstable, and mostly one-directional. She pays, he delivers, and he stays alive.

> *“Shemeshka... is the kind of powerful that doesn’t need to raise her voice. Careful around her. She owns more than you think, and less than she pretends. But whatever game she’s playing, we’re all pieces on her board.”*

## Valkor's Role in Sigil

- A **neutral element in a polarized city**, he balances precariously between loyalty and anonymity.
- He is known to many as a “face,” but never the _same_ face.
- Though seen as low-level, he possesses a _bizarre network of trivial-seeming favors_ and access, making him the spider in a web only he understands.
- He believes something fundamental is _broken_ in Sigil after the glitch—he has dreams, flashes, and gut-pulls to places and people he shouldn't remember.

## Valkor's Role to the Characters

- In the **original timeline**, Josbert may have been ally or adversary—it doesn’t matter, because _he remembers them_. Not as memories, but as _emotional impressions_.
- When the Guvners declare the party criminals, **he impersonates a Harmonium officer** and extracts them, claiming jurisdiction.
- He leads them into **Undersigil**, offering asylum under the guise of rerouting them to a "safe ward."
- His motives seem unclear—even to him. He’s **drawn** to the party. He doesn’t know why, and he hates not knowing.


### Valkor's Sewer Banter (Ambient Dialogue)

- **(grumbling as they duck a low pipe)**
> "Sigil’s bowels. Still cleaner than the Civic Festhall."
- **(as he steps over a broken sign reading “No Entry”)**
> "Rules don’t reach this deep. That’s either good for us… or terrible."
- **(after a distant clang echoes)**
> "Could be a pipe. Could be something that eats people. Don’t linger."
- **(passing by a wall etched with runes)**
> "Markings like these? That’s Red Circuit turf. Try not to look like money."
- **(if the party gets suspicious)**
> "If I wanted you dead, I’d have let the Harmonium do the paperwork."
- **(as they walk through a corridor of hanging chains)**
> "People forget this place has layers. History doesn’t die here—it just rots louder."
- **(after a brief pause near a sealed iron door)**
> "Used to be a hideout behind there. Got cleared out. Badly. No one uses it now… unless they’re desperate."
- **(sarcastic, as he kicks aside a rat skeleton)**
> "Friendly locals. If they ask, we’re not tourists."
