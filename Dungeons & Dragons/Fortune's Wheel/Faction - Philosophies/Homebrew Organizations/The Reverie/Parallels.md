#### Early Soviet Ideological Engineering (Political-Historical Parallel)

- The notion of reshaping not only society but the **individual mind** and **reality itself** via propaganda, education, and control mirrors the Reverie’s approach.
- Like early Bolsheviks under Lenin or Stalin, the Reverie use **false heroes**, **rewriting of histories**, and **total control over narrative** to reform society—starting from the margins (peasants → barmies).
- People are given **“second chances”** in a utopia they didn’t ask for—**remade** to serve a vision.

##### Post-Structuralism & Postmodernism (Intellectual Parallel)

- Thinkers like **Michel Foucault**, **Jacques Derrida**, and **Jean Baudrillard** questioned the nature of truth, authority, and reality.
- Baudrillard especially ties in through his concept of **"simulacra"**—where **representations of things replace the things themselves**, leading to **hyperreality**.
- The Reverie thrive in this space: **belief is reality**, and the simulation (e.g., manufactured divinity or resurrection) becomes the truth.
