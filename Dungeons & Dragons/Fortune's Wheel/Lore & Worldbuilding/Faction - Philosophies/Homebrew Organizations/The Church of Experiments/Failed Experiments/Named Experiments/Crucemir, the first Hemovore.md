Crucemir wasn’t a prisoner, a rebel, or a heretic—he was a **believer**.
- A mid-ranking biothaumaturge in the Church of Experiments, Crucemir was deeply committed to the Glorious Evolution.
- He helped develop the early bio-filtration engines and emotion dampeners used in Project Hemovore.
- He **volunteered** for human trials. Not out of arrogance—but because he believed no one else could survive what he had helped design.

## The Affliction

The Hemovore doesn’t drink blood for sustenance—it gorges on the essence of biological integrity:

- Marrow. Organ-meat. Spine. Nerve-root.
- The wet architecture of living creatures—not just blood, but structure.
- Vital density. The raw, biological foundation of life.

> The Hemovore devours what makes living creatures function, turning them into hollowed husks, their fluids and tissues replaced with sludgy arcano-ichor.

The more robust, vital and structured the organism, the more sustaining the feast. A frail elder provides barely a sip. A young warrior, an intoxicating banquet.

When a Hemovore feeds, it does not sip. It pierces, it unwraps. It eats from within. 
- Their mouth can fracture, opening like a predator's blooming maw.
- Their tongues extends, threaded with spiral barbs, burrowing into spine or sternum.
- The ribcage of their target often implodes under negative pressure.
- The host's organs are liquefied ins seconds and siphoned through rapidly pulsating channels in the Hemovore's own chest.

Its grotesque, noisy, efficient. It leaves behind a sagging sack of skin, often still warm. Still twitching.

### Why Crucemir Survived

The trial was not supposed to be violent. 
Crucemir expected pain. He did not expect to wake up starving.
The Hunger began with heat in the spine, like metal curling under forge fire. Then came the nausea, then the shuddering taste of tissue in the air. He consumed the test-blood packs in his recovery cell, but they did not satisfy him.
He broke into the adjacent vivisection vault and killed three interns before realizing what he'd done. 
It was not rage. It was not confusion. It was instinct–cold, clean, predatory.

### The Exile

He stood before the Church tribunal willingly, believing they would help him correct the process. But he saw only revulsion in the faces of his peers.
Even the Master, still a dominant figure then, looked upon him and said:

> *"You gorged. You overindulged. You broke containment. That is failure–not evolution.*

No cure was offered. No study of survival. No purpose remained.
He was not terminated–termination is a cost to the Church.
He was sealed inside a containment coffin and discarded into the Lower Planes, like chemical runoff.

### The toll Of Devouring

Crucemir's earliest years after exile were not survival, they were mourning.

As he fed, the tissues he devoured rebuilt him–not just repairing, but replacing.

> *"My femur was once mine. Now it belongs to a minotaur priest i killed in fever*



After each feeding, he dreams of being eaten himself–flesh folding inward, bones slurping into gut, his own body consuming itself endlessly. 

>*"There is no hunger like mine. Not even death has tasted what i have tasted.*

### The Man that Remains

Now, Crucemir wanders the shadows of the planes with one foot in purpose and the other in guilt.

He wears his researcher’s coat—tattered, scorched, mended—like a shroud.
He still speaks to himself in the tenets of the Church, quoting scripture before battle.

He still believes in the Glorious Evolution—but sees the Church as having betrayed its own ideal by discarding failure instead of refining it.

He seeks:
- To find others like him—not Hemovores, but failures who lived.
- To warn those still within the Church about what it costs to be "unfinished."
- To correct the experiment—not out of revenge, but out of integrity.

However:
- Crucemir may be the final iteration of Hemovore.
- Every feeding sustains him longer—but also hardens him.
- One day, he may become too refined to remember what he was trying to fix.

#### Appearance:

Crucemir is the image of a man who has died many times but refuses to rot.

- **Skin**: Ashen-gray, nearly translucent in places—like parchment stretched over muscle. Runes and sigils in old script flicker faintly across his veins, lighting up when he feeds or becomes enraged.
- **Eyes**: Deep-set and black, but shot through with veins of crimson light that pulse like a second heartbeat. 
- **Hair**: Long, unkempt, and streaked with silver and black. Tied loosely behind his head with surgical wire.
- **Build**: Gaunt but sinewy. His limbs move with inhuman grace, twitching sometimes with suppressed emotion.
- **Fangs**: Barely visible unless he speaks in anger, but when bared, they drip with threads of silver-red ichor.
