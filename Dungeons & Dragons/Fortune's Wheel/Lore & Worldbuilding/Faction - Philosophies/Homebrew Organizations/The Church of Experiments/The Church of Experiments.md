*The flesh is fallible. The machine is precise. Our duty is to bridge the gap.*

The Church of Experiments is not a faith, but a philosophy—a relentless pursuit of perfection through technological augmentation. It is a scientific cabal, a corporate-theocratic machine, and an organization of radical visionaries, all devoted to the idea that biology is merely a starting point for something greater.

They do not worship gods, nor do they serve any singular power. Instead, they view the universe as a vast laboratory, and themselves as its leading researchers. Their belief is cold, rational, and unwavering:

> *Life itself is an experiment. The unmodified are merely unfinished subjects.*

To the Church, the natural world is a failed prototype, and their mission is to correct it—to create a superior form of existence, free from the frailties of flesh.

However, their methods are not universally accepted. Many see them as monstrous, as butchers of the soul, as unfeeling machinists who view all life as disposable material. The Church, however, does not care for morality—only results.

# The Doctrine of Innovation: The Church's Core Beliefs

> *Perfection is a process, not a state. The machine is refined, iterated and improved. So too must the body and mind evolve, or be discarded.*

## Core Tenets

1. **The Imperfection of Flesh** – The biological body is a crude, inefficient machine—a framework to be optimized, refined, and replaced.
2. **Experimentation is Sacrament** – Progress must be tested on the living; there is no knowledge without experimentation. Those who volunteer are saints; those who resist are merely raw materials.
3. **The Doctrine of Enhancement** – Cybernetic modification is not a choice, but a duty. Every augmentation brings one closer to enlightenment.
4. **The Machine as Divinity** – If the gods exist, they are irrelevant—for what use is worship when one can become greater?
5. **Unity Through Efficiency** – The Church is a collective; individuals must serve the greater experiment. Personal ambition is only tolerated if it furthers the mission.
6. **Failure Must Be Studied** – Every experiment, even catastrophic failures, are valuable data points. There is no heresy greater than destroying knowledge.


The Church likely aligns with the [[Mind's Eye]] faction, as this group believes in self-improvement and the pursuit of personal power. The [[Athar]] might also have influence in the Church, denying the power of the gods in favor of mortal ingenuity.

# The Church's Structure & Hierarchy

## The Apex Directive (The High Overseer)

At the top sits the **Apex Directive**—a council of the most enhanced, most brilliant, and most ruthless minds within the Church. Some are fully cybernetic, their flesh long abandoned, their minds stored in experimental databanks. Others exist as consciousnesses suspended between reality and code, directing the Church through cold calculation and absolute logic.

- They oversee all major projects, ensuring that experimentation follows doctrine.
- Only the most transcendent minds can become part of the Apex Directive.
- Their word is law—to question them is to question progress itself.

| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |


## The Fabricators (Cyber-Priests & Lead Researchers)

Beneath the **Apex Directive** are the **Fabricators**, the Church’s ruling scientists, engineers, and cyber-theologians.

- They serve as both scientists and priests, acting as leaders of research cells and enforcers of doctrine.
- Each Fabricator is responsible for an aspect of the Church’s grand experiment—some focus on bioengineering, others on neural enhancements, and some on weapons of war.
- Fabricators rarely interact with the outside world—they work within the deepest sanctums of the Church, crafting new bodies, new implants, and new ways to ascend.

## The Augurs (Cybernetic Enforcers & Experimenters)

The **Augurs** are field researchers, scientists, and enforcers—they take theory and test it in the real world.

- Some Augurs hunt for subjects, seeking out new test subjects or capturing failed experiments for further study.
- Others oversee implantation procedures, ensuring that new augmentations are properly integrated into the faithful.
- Many serve as the Church’s intelligence operatives, infiltrating Sigil’s factions, corporations, and black markets, looking for new technologies to assimilate.**


## The Excisionists (Eradicators of Failure)

Failure is tolerated—so long as it provides data. But when a failure becomes dangerous, it must be eliminated.

- The **Excisionists** are the Church’s executioners—tasked with hunting down escaped test subjects, rogue scientists, and those who betray doctrine.
- They are feared, even within the Church, for they are merciless and unwavering.
- The Master’s existence as a Necromaton is their greatest failure—and they have sworn to erase him from history.

>*"The master was a failure of doctrine. We must not allow more to follow his path." —Church Overseer*

# The Master: The Church's Ultimate Failure

> *When we think of immortality, many of us think not of flesh, but of steel. Cold, hard, unfeeling metal will outlast all biological matter.*

The Master was once among them. He was a Fabricator, a genius of biomechanics and soul-transference theory, one of the greatest minds the Church had ever produced.

But he betrayed them.

His vision was too radical, too uncontrolled. He did not seek perfection within doctrine—he sought personal transcendence, beyond the Church’s constraints.

### The Grand Conjuration: The Master's Rebirth

The Grand Conjuration was meant to be his final experiment—a ritual to merge soul and machine in a way that no one had dared attempt before.

The Church sent enforcers to stop him, but it was too late.

In a cataclysm of smoke, fire, and shattered steel, the Master succeeded. He became the first true Necromaton—a being whose soul is no longer bound to one body, but instead inhabits multiple constructs at will.

> *Flesh, bone, blood—these are relics of a bygone age. I am something new. A being of thought, metal, and will.*

### Why the Church Fears Him

- He broke free from their control, proving that individual transcendence is possible—a threat to the Church’s entire doctrine.
- He builds his own bodies, crafting a legion of phylacteries, making him impossible to truly destroy.
- He has begun experimenting on others, trying to create more Necromatons, threatening to corrupt the Church’s vision.

### To Erase the Master

The Master is their greatest failure, and now, he is their greatest priority.

- They will burn entire cities if it means destroying his research.
- They will sacrifice thousands to ensure no more Necromatons are created.
- They will stop at nothing to see him destroyed completely.

> *He is not a man. He is not a machine. He is a herecy made manifest. We will burn his works, shatter his mind, and erase his legacy from the annals of history.*
