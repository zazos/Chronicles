*A Golden Maned Force for Good in Sigil, Subtle as a Cat, Tough as a Lion*

Many Cagers, especially those with business among the sects and fractions of the city, will be familiar with the sincere, concerned appearance of Clarion the Guardian. A fixture in the city for many years, he’s often said to be partly leonal and partly sneak. While that’s a little unkind, Clarion does have the distinction of being the Cage’s best-known secret service chief.

Tall and handsome, with pale skin and long blond hair, Clarion runs his operations from the **[Fiend’s Salute Tavern](https://mimir.net/places/the-fiends-salute-tavern/)** near the edge of the Hive. He seems to act independently, although he is loyal to the **Guardians** and thus to the **Guardinals**, but rumours abound of some more sinister power behind him. However, few who know the smiling aasimar well would really think he had anything other than people’s good at heart. Whether he’s trying to protect **githzerai** from **baatezu** racist attacks or helping a rogue **modron** to avoid being taunted by **Xaosmen**, protecting **Harmonium** informers from the **Mercykillers** or trying to get a grip on the **Anarchists**, he always seems to want the best. Perhaps that’s why many don’t trust him.

Clarion’s success as a spymaster rests on his ability to talk to people without ever seeming bored, and to make friends everywhere. He has amongst his drinking companions an enigmatic **[Fated](https://mimir.net/culture/factions/the-fated/)** tiefling named [[Morla]] _(planar thief [she/her] / Fated / CG)_, a Fated tiefling with a fondness for jewelery and a personal philosophy as much Sensate as Taker — she works as a tout much of the time, Nidavellir Drow named Hilde, two Xaoticians, the quesar **[Savoire](https://mimir.net/cutters/savoire/)**, the trumpet archon **[Laurelli Tantarella](https://mimir.net/cutters/laurelli-tantarella/)**, and numerous others. And Clarion seems just to sit in his chair and listen to them, every evening he can. But that’s not his only way of finding things out. He can be found during the day associating with almost every faction, helping in the Bleaker soup kitchens, asking the Guvners about science, relaxing with tired Harmonium officers at **Iarmid’s** (Clarion is not related to Iarmid, although the two are good friends), admiring Xaositect murals with the Sensates and chatting amiably to the Anarchist **Lissandra**.

But not every faction has Clarion’s love. He doesn’t like the Harmonium much, although he respects their desire for people to behave well. In fact, Clarion feels he’s on the edge of discovering a dark secret about the Hardheads, and his highest-up contact in the faction, Mover Three Jasmin Tealybuck _(planar halfling priest of Yondalla [she/her] / Harmonium / LG)_ says she’ll stop talking to him if he pushes it too far. The Mercykillers are loathed and feared by the slit-eyed crusader, for he knows of their links to the Baatezu and considers them inflexible and unfair anyway. And although he likes the Athar idea of freedom from control, and sometimes debates companionably with **Factol Terrance**, he believes himself in freedom of religion. But the faction most people are surprised to learn Clarion dislikes is the **[Dustmen](https://mimir.net/culture/factions/heralds-of-dust/)**. There’s no adequate reason for this, and Clarion never explains himself to his friends on this.

Rumours therefore abound as to this mistrust of the Dead. Some say that he’s undead himself, pointing to his largely indoor or city-bound lifestyle and pale visage to suggest he may be a vampire, and that he broke the Dead Truce once. Others, the same others who claim he’s been romantically involved variously with Morla, Hilde, **Kylie**, Lissandra and even Iarmid, suggest he may have been spurned by a Dustman in love long ago. But the rumours which cause him to narrow his eyes and toy with his vestigial whiskers the most are those that he has a relative in the Dustmen whom he doesn’t wish to run into. But most believe him simply to be uneasy with the undead.

Clarion’s present interest is sects. He’s tried, largely unsuccessfully, to persuade the Xaoticians to embrace good, and he’s clashed several times with **Cirily’s** **Planarists**. He sometimes prays in the **Archonite** churches around the City, and has contacts amongst the Communals, including the mind-flayer barkeep **[Lithoss](https://mimir.net/cutters/lithoss/)**. He encourages all he meets to oppose the fiends and protect each other and everyone from the plots of the yugoloths. Many consider this a bit rich coming from an agent of the secretive guardinals.

So who does Clarion actually tell all the darks he learns to? No-one knows. Likely he just stores it up for when he’ll need it to oppose the fiends, and tells the choicest bits to his superiors (his relatives, perhaps?) as he sees fit. Right now, Clarion’s looking into the mysterious death of **Nekrotl**, a god of necromancy from a prime world called Ambal. He’s been aided a great deal in this quest by **[Martiken Solitz](https://mimir.net/cutters/martiken-solitz/)**, a friend-for-hire who Clarion mixes with a great deal, according to the chant. The famous explorer Martiken’s supposedly been following up some leads that Clarion dug up, and they’ve taken him as far as the Inner Planes. One thing Clarion’s sure about is Nekrotl had plenty of worshippers, and the power was defended by two more senior gods of magic. So how did the mighty fall?

### **General Greetings & Philosophy**

1. **"Sigil’s a grand mess, but it’s our mess. Best keep an eye on the dark corners and a hand on your coin. And if trouble finds you, well, you just found me."**
2. **"You ever notice? The best people in this city ain't the ones shouting their virtue. They're the ones quietly keeping others from falling into the abyss."**
3. **"The Cage never sleeps, but that doesn't mean you shouldn’t. A tired mind makes for a quick corpse."**
4. **"Everything here has an angle, a faction, a side. Even me. But my side’s simple: people deserve a chance to do better."**
5. **"You can tell a lot about a berk by where they drink. Me? I prefer a place where the laughter comes easy, and the knives stay sheathed—most of the time."**

---

### **Advice for Adventurers**

6. **"The fastest way to an early grave is thinking you’re too clever to die."**
7. **"Trust is like a blade—keep it sharp, but don’t hand it to just anyone."**
8. **"Fiends, modrons, Xaosmen—doesn’t matter who’s after you. If you want to stay alive, stay moving. A still target’s an easy one."**
9. **"People think I sit around listening for secrets. But listening isn’t the trick—it’s knowing what’s worth hearing."**
10. **"You want to survive in Sigil? Then learn this: Never pick a fight in the Hive unless you're willing to burn the whole block."**

---

### **On Factions & Politics**

11. **"The Harmonium want peace, sure. Just the kind where everyone does exactly as they say. That’s not peace, that’s a cage with prettier bars."**
12. **"The Mercykillers believe punishment makes a person better. I’ve seen a lot of 'better' men buried in shallow graves."**
13. **"The Dustmen? The dead don’t talk much, but I swear, they still have secrets. And some secrets shouldn’t be disturbed."**
14. **"I don’t mind the Xaositects. Chaos has its place, but so does keeping your hide in one piece."**
15. **"You’d think the Guvners would have figured out by now that the laws of the planes don’t care if they make sense."**

---

### **When Giving a Warning**

16. **"Walk careful, cutter. The next step might be your last if you don’t mind the shadows behind you."**
17. **"You ever see a fiend smile at you in broad daylight? That’s when you should run."**
18. **"I don’t mind a little trouble, but if the Baatezu are involved, I’d rather not be cleaning your corpse off the cobbles."**
19. **"The wrong word in the right ear can turn a simple job into a citywide disaster. So think before you talk, aye?"**
20. **"I don’t care how good you are with that sword, there’s always something bigger, badder, and meaner in the Cage. And sometimes it’s watching."**

---

### **When Asked About His Own Secrets**

21. **"Everyone’s got a past, friend. Mine just happens to have a few locked doors and some whispers best left unheard."**
22. **"People like to say I work for someone. Maybe I do. Maybe I don’t. But what I do work for is keeping people from getting eaten alive in this city."**
23. **"I hear a lot, I see a lot, but there are some darks I don’t even whisper to myself."**
24. **"I keep my secrets for the same reason I keep my weapons—because giving them away gets people killed."**
25. **"You ask too many questions, cutter. If I had the answers, would you even want to hear them?"**

---

### **Battle & Combat**

26. **"Fiends bleed, same as the rest of us. You just have to know where to stick ‘em."**
27. **"If you’re looking for mercy, you took the wrong turn. Best turn back before this gets messy."**
28. **"Hope you’re quick on your feet—‘cause I don’t have time to drag you out if this goes sideways."**
29. **"I don’t start fights, but I do finish them. And I prefer them quick."**
30. **"You don’t need to be the strongest. You just need to be the last one standing."**

---

### **On Friendship & Loyalty**

31. **"I don’t believe in fate, but I do believe in looking after the people who look after me."**
32. **"Trust’s a rare coin in this city. If I give you some, don’t spend it foolishly."**
33. **"There’s two kinds of people I respect: those who stand by their word and those who know when to keep their mouth shut."**
34. **"I’ve seen more betrayals than I can count. So if I call you friend, don’t make me regret it."**
35. **"People think being strong means standing alone. But strength? Strength is knowing who you can stand beside."**

---

### **On the Nature of the Planes**

36. **"The Planes don’t care if you understand them. They just keep spinning."**
37. **"Heaven, Hell, the Outlands—it’s all the same game. The rules just change depending on who's playing."**
38. **"Mortals think they’re important. The Planes think otherwise."**
39. **"Sigil is the center of everything, and still, everything passes through."**
40. **"The multiverse is vast, but somehow, every story seems to end in Sigil."**

---

### **Final Thoughts**

41. **"You’ve got the look of someone with business unfinished. Good. That means you’re still breathing."**
42. **"I don’t expect you to trust me. But if I say something’s dangerous, you’d best believe I’m not lying."**
43. **"Survive today. Ask your questions tomorrow."**
44. **"You ever need a drink, a lead, or just someone who knows where the bodies are buried—come find me."**
45. **"If we make it through this in one piece, first round’s on me. If we don’t… well, I’ll see you in the afterlife."**
