**Fall-from-Grace** was a succubus cleric and philosopher, who conquered her evil roots and after escaping the lower planes became the proprietress of the Brothel for Slaking Intellectual Lusts in the Clerks' Ward district of Sigil.

### Description
**Fall-from-Grace** was a strikingly beautiful woman. She had long-golden hair, azure eyes and two sleek wings. She frequently wore a dark blue and violet tunic.
She could not stand the feeling of the touch of metal like many of her kin, and thus would never carry any such objects. Thus, if a need for combat had arisen, she would use her lethal succubus kiss as a weapon.

### Personality
**Fall-from-Grace** in many ways was the polar opposite of the succubus archetype. She would not rely on her beautiful appearance to persuade anybody. Additionally, she was undeniably chaste and had no interest in pleasures of the flesh. She valued a good conversation and new intellectual experiences above all, to the point where she founded an establishment dedicated to just that.

She was extremely perceptive, skilled in the art of discussion and exceedingly intelligent (something which allowed her to escape the Nine Hells). She was very calm and composed, able to retain a clear mind in all conditions. She was very cordial towards everybody at all times, even if the other party was downright insulting her

### Relationships

She was a daughter of [[Red Shroud]], the succubus ruler of the [[Broken Reach]] fortress in **Pazunia**. Due to her lineage, **Fall-from-Grace** faced a lot of prejudice from other people. It was difficult for her to earn the trust of anybody, as most presumed she had ulterior motives. For instance, **Vrischika** the Importer, the alu-fiend proprietor of the Curiosity Shoppe located not far from Grace's establishment, was stubborn in saying that her behavior and good-aligned values were a part of a greater ruse. Nonetheless, the workers and patrons of her brothel have grown to trust her and appreciate her in full.

### History

When **Fall-from-Grace** was still very young, she was sold into baatezu slavery by her own mother, despite the succubi being allied with the tanar'ri at the time, and thus being the devils' sworn enemies. She spent many long years enduring mental torture in the Nine Hells. During this time, she took the opportunity to hone her conversational and intellectual skills, and eventually through clever interpretation of language and infernal contracts, she was able to break her captivity and escape.

 – Fall-from-Grace about the origins of her name

Sometime after she was freed, she ended up within Sigil, where she joined the [[Society of Sensation]], which allowed her to to further pursue the experiences and development that she sought. Not far from the headquarters of the [[Society of Sensation|Sensates]], she established the **Brothel for Slaking Intellectual Lusts**, which allowed its customers to engage in intellectual debate and conversation with its workers.
