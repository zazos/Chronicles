### **The Reverie: A Cult of Salvation and Discord**

The Reverie as an organization functions less like a faction vying for control and more like a **philosophical cult**, devoted to **reframing reality itself** for those who have lost their grasp on it. Unlike the Dustmen, who believe in the True Death as the final release, the Reverie believe in **reinvention**, the idea that death—true death—is a failure, an endpoint that should be rejected. Instead, life is an endless series of **second chances**, provided one is willing to accept a new **truth**.

### **Veylith: The Messiah of the Forgotten**


![[Veylith the Unwritten.png]]

Veylith, at the heart of this movement, is a **man of conviction**—or at least, that’s how he presents himself. He does not claim to be a god. He does not demand worship. Instead, he claims to be an **architect of divine intervention**, an unseen force that provides **the lowest of the low**—the barmies, the abandoned, the forgotten—with the **gift of meaning**.

- **The Barmies as the Perfect Candidates**: They are people already detached from reality. They’ve seen things that others haven’t, and they no longer fit into the rigid, dogmatic structure of Sigil’s faction system. They are discarded like refuse. Who better to **remake reality for** than those who are already convinced that reality is malleable?
- **"A Second Chance" as a Core Tenet**: Veylith’s philosophy is that _belief is the strongest force in the multiverse._ Gods only exist because mortals believe in them. Sigil itself bends under the weight of its own myths. The Reverie, then, are those who _control_ belief, and in doing so, they control the fate of those who have lost everything. (Best aligned with Mind's Eye)
- **Not a Tyrant, but a Prophet**: Veylith does not seek to _rule_ Sigil. It's an absurd proposition. Instead, he seeks to **undo** the rigid **power structures** that make Sigil a prison of ideologies. The Factions are stagnant, locked in eternal debate, balance, and paranoia. But what if all of them collapsed under the weight of **a new reality**? One shaped not by ancient dogma, but by the people who have been discarded by it?
- **The Grand Plan**: The Illuminated do not want to _rule_—they want to **reshape**. By **seeding false prophets**, planting **divinely "saved" agents** within Sigil, and slowly **corrupting** its faction-based society from within, Veylith is creating a reality where _nothing can be trusted_, where the belief that held Sigil together for eons begins to fray.

> _When the Godsmen can no longer tell who is truly ascending._  
> When the Dustmen can no longer tell who is truly dead.
> _When the Sign of One begins to wonder whether reality is slipping from their grasp._  
> _When the Mercykillers start executing innocent people because their own informants have been planted to lie._

And at the height of this **crisis of reality**, when **factions are at each other’s throats,** the Reverie will have cultivated **an entire secret society of people who owe their very existence to a lie**—one that **Veylith created.**

### **Philosophy of the Reverie**

The Reverie do not act out of greed, nor do they claim to serve a single power. Instead, their core beliefs are as follows:

1. **Truth is a prison** – The factions of Sigil preach dogma, but in reality, they are simply enforcing a structure that does not serve those who are discarded. The world is built on false beliefs, and it is time to rewrite them.
2. **Belief is the strongest force in the multiverse** – Gods, cities, factions—all exist only because mortals believe they do. The Reverie seek to manipulate this principle, reshaping reality by _crafting_ new faiths, new divine interventions, and ultimately, **a new paradigm** for those who have nothing.
3. **Death is a failure of imagination** – The Dustmen see death as the ultimate goal, but the Reverie see it as **a failure to reinvent oneself**. The "resurrection" of the barmies is not just a trick—it is a **reprogramming of the self**, a chance to escape the fate that society assigned them.
4. **Discord is a tool, not a goal** – Unlike anarchists, the Reverie do not cause discord for its own sake. Instead, it is a **method**—a means of destabilizing the **false foundations** of Sigil’s factions, so that new ideas may take their place.

### **Villainous Potential of Veylith**

Veylith is a villain not because he’s a tyrant or a conqueror—but because he is **right**. In a way, he does offer **a better life** to the discarded, the forgotten, and the mad. He does **save people** in a way no faction ever could.

But at the same time, his methods are **insidious**:

- He **takes away agency** in a way no god does—because the people he "saves" never choose to be part of this.
- He **destabilizes the very fabric of Sigil**—which, for all its faults, has always endured. He could **break something fundamental** about the City of Doors.
- He **manipulates faith itself**, turning belief into a weapon and undermining the very thing that sustains gods, factions, and even the Lady of Pain’s delicate balance.

And yet… in the heart of it all… Veylith would say that he’s done nothing wrong. **He gave them a second chance.** The world cast them away. He saved them. Is it his fault they owe him everything?

---

### **Final Thoughts**

Veylith is **not** a power-hungry dictator. He is **a philosopher**, a visionary, a man who has taken the principles of belief and reality and **weaponized them against Sigil’s stagnant system**. He is a man who offers **genuine salvation**, but only at the cost of truth itself.

His end goal is not **control**—it is **the rewriting of reality**. And that? That’s the kind of villain that **no faction** is equipped to handle.



The **Reverie** absolutely echo aspects of the **Athars** and **the Mind’s Eye**, but with a **twist**—they **take their beliefs to a dangerous extreme** and **weaponize** them against the very fabric of Sigil’s reality. Rather than simply denying the power of gods (like the Athars) or seeking self-ascension (like the Mind’s Eye), the Reverie act as **puppet masters of belief itself**, enforcing their own vision of "reality" upon others.

---

### **The Reverie as a Hidden Coterie of the Grand Factions**

A **coterie** in Sigil is typically a **loose group of faction members** who share a specific ideology but don’t necessarily act as an official faction of their own. The Reverie could have emerged as **a convergence of radical thinkers** drawn from multiple factions, forming an underground network dedicated to a **greater revelation**.

#### **Factions That May Have Fed into the Reverie' Formation**

1. **The Athars ("Defiers") – Skeptics of the Gods**
    
    - The Athars reject the divine, claiming the so-called gods are nothing more than cosmic tyrants demanding worship.
    - Some among them, instead of simply denying the gods, sought to **prove** that belief itself is what grants them power—and that it can be manipulated.
    - A radical Athar sect, realizing that gods **depend on faith**, experimented with **falsifying divine intervention**—leading directly to the Reverie’s core method of "resurrecting" the barmies and giving them false revelations.
2. **The Mind’s Eye – The Power of Self-Determination**
    
    - The Mind’s Eye believe in **self-ascension**, the idea that mortals can shape their own fate.
    - Some within the faction took this to the extreme: _If the mind is the key to becoming greater, why not reshape the minds of others?_
    - These thinkers found kinship with the Athar defectors and helped develop the idea that **one can manufacture belief to sculpt reality itself**.
3. **The Revolutionary League (Anarchists) – Destroying Structures**
    
    - The Revolutionary League wants to **topple** Sigil’s power structures, but many of its members are **directionless**, often causing chaos without meaningful long-term goals.
    - A small, intellectual cell within the Anarchists realized that **factions aren’t toppled by riots—but by ideas.**
    - They joined the Reverie, using their **infiltration skills** to plant agents in **key positions across Sigil’s factions**, introducing **contradictory philosophies** to destabilize them from within.

### **How the Reverie Differ from Their Parent Factions**

While the Reverie **borrow from** these factions, they go further than any of them ever dared. Their key divergence is that they **don’t just reject or reinterpret belief—they actively engineer it**. They aren’t philosophers or mere anarchists; they are **practitioners of applied metaphysics**, actively reshaping reality **by controlling the people who hold belief itself.**

- **The Athars disbelieve in gods** → The Reverie **manufacture gods**
- **The Mind’s Eye preaches self-determination** → The Reverie **erase and rebuild identities**
- **The Anarchists sow chaos** → The Reverie **cultivate ideological warfare**


### And why they stay hidden

1. Their methods are too dangerous to be public
	1. The Reverie do not simply recruit barmies - they erase them.
	2. By using feign death spells and abducting the mentally unstable, they remove the most fragile minds in Sigil and dispose of them permanently.
2. They are challenging the fundamental order of Sigil
	1. Belief shaped the multiverse and the factions maintain balance in Sigil's chaotic ecosystem. If the Reverie's methods were discovered:
		1. The Mercykillers would hunt them down for their abductions and executions.
		2. The Mind's Eye would seek to undo their false realities, fearing the loss of their own reality-shaping philosophy.
		3. The Dustmen would label them as dangerous heretics for perverting the nature of death.
3. Their work requires controller,  careful manipulation
	1. They are not a revolutionary army, they are infiltrators and illusionists.
	2. The factions of Sigil cannot be toppled overnight. The Reverie needs time to plant doubts, break faiths and spread uncertainty.
	3. To act openly would force factions to unify against them and faction war is not their goal.
	4. *They do not want to rule the city, the want to make it forget what i once was.*


### Recruitment

1. **True Believers**: Intellectuals, philosophers and disillusioned thinkers who join willingly, drawn by the faction's ideas.
	1. High ranking and most devoted Reverie members were never manipulated. They were drawn into the faction willingly, believing in Veylith's grand vision.
2. **Engineered Agents**: "Saved" barmies and faction members unknowingly acting as pawns to spread chaos.
	1. These reborn agents are told they are given a second chance at life by an unknown higher power, guiding them into a specific faction to fulfill their newfound purpose.
	2. The Reverie do not see these people as members however. They are tools, they will never be told the truth.
3. **Compromised & Indoctrinated**: People coerced, blackmailed or forcibly recruited when they learn too much. 
	1. The Reverie blackmails, traps and gaslights people in positions of power to keep their secrets hidden.
		1. Mercykiller informants unknowingly execute the wrong people (framed by the Reverie)


## How Would the Reverie view the PCs?

**An Opportunity to Exploit:**  
Such a powerful anomaly could provide leverage to further their plans. If the Reverie can decipher how the PCs returned independently, they may use that knowledge to refine their own practices or even weaponize the PCs as false prophets—proof of divine intervention they themselves control or claim credit for.

**A Puzzle to Solve:**  
Curious and analytical by nature, the higher-ranking Reverie (particularly Imogen and Veylith) would initially view the PCs as an enigma—an enticing mystery. How did these individuals bypass their orchestrated cycles of rebirth? Could another entity be employing similar or superior methods?

**Feigning Benevolence:**  
Imogen might initially present herself as genuinely concerned, intrigued, and even supportive of the PCs. She would position the Reverie as kindred spirits—misunderstood, sympathetic philosophers who offer real answers and genuine help to people lost or broken by reality.

**Soft Indoctrination and Influence:**  
Rather than directly recruiting or confronting, Imogen would attempt a gradual indoctrination process. By posing philosophical questions, presenting ethical dilemmas mirroring the Reverie's ideals, and offering the PCs resources, allies, or "answers," she would subtly steer them toward alignment with their philosophy without forcing commitment.

## Work with or against the Reverie?

### **Working Together:** (Conditional Alliance)

- The Reverie might temporarily see the PCs as useful agents or allies, providing them with information, resources, or protection.
    
- This alliance would likely be manipulative, aiming to study the PCs closely or direct them against factions or entities threatening the Reverie.
    
- Eventually, if the PCs align closely enough philosophically, the Reverie may consider genuinely integrating them—but always under watchful suspicion.

### **Working Against:** (Likely in the Long-Term)

- If the PCs become threats, defy manipulation, or uncover the Reverie’s true methods, Imogen and the Reverie would shift quickly from intrigue to opposition.
    
- Rather than direct conflict, they'd employ gaslighting, misinformation, sabotage, or subtle assassination attempts. The Reverie would ensure the PCs' very existence would become discredited or suspicious within Sigil.
