# Arrival

[[outlands arrival.webp|Show To Players]]

*You find yourself standing amid ruins of weathered black marble. The last recognisable remnant of these ruins, a solitary stone archway, provides a frame for the portal you just passed through. Glittering, deep-blue sand spreads before you in all directions. Great impact divots mark the passage of something enormous. The trail leads toward a sudden transition in the terrain, where a forest of magenta trees climbs craggy hills that look like wizened faces.*
*Much farther in the distance, an impossibly tall stone spire stretches from the horizon into the clouds.*

The portal from Sigil opens into a nameless ruin in the Outlands that is roughly halfway between the Spire and the gate-town of Torch. This gate-town can be seen in the horizon asa immense bridge-like structures loom over the region.

*In the distance, you see the gate-town of Torch—a jagged cluster of volcanic spires rising from a blood-red marsh, their blackened slopes veined with glowing rivers of molten rock. Immense bridge-like structures arc between the spires, linking walled districts perched high above the pestilent swamps below. Even from here, the air seems to shimmer with heat, and a faint, ruddy glow bathes the town in perpetual twilight as plumes of smoke twist skyward.*

The portal, which leads back to Sigil is no longer active and evaporates in the air. 
The surreal nature of the surrounding desert, forest, and hills, as well as the rapid transition between the terrains, is natural for the Outlands.

Following the trail is easy and leads towards the magenta forest.

# The Walking Castle

*Amid a grove of strange trees stands an ornate tower. Around it, toppled pillars lie scattered. A short stairway rises from the ground to a stone terrace, where six openings lead into the structure.*

The walking castle [[Walking Castle Map|Iedcaru]] is a treasure from ages past. It was created by githzerai as a hermitage where ascetics could travel the Outlands and meditate
on the nature of realms beyond. While the castle has been forgotten by most githzerai scholars in Limbo, it remains the home of [[Zaythir]], a sage who seeks
to glean multiversal truths from mystical planar forces.

[[Walking Castle Map|Iedcaru]]  has recently seen more visitors than usual. The first was the modron R04M, which stopped at the castle and learned much about the Outlands.
More recently, though, a host of Fiends discovered and occupied the castle. They’ve captured [[Zaythir]] and are now working to discover how to operate the
castle. 

The fiends are seeking to claim the castle and sell it as a war machine. They are not associated with Shemeshka at all.
