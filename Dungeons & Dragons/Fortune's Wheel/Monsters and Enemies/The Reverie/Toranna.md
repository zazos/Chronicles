### **Encounter Tactics**

- **Opens with Spirit Guardians** to create an **area of sustained necrotic damage** while forcing melee fighters to stay away.
- Uses **Hold Person** and **Bane** to cripple enemy frontline fighters.
- Activates **Divine Eminence with a 3rd-level slot** early to make **each hit devastating.**
- Drinks **Potion of Invisibility** if reduced to half HP, repositioning before using **Blight or Circle of Death** as a massive **AoE nuke**.
- If at risk of dying, she triggers **Undying Will** and **teleports away** using **Dark Step** for a dramatic last stand.

### **Loot Ideas (If the Party Wins)**

- **Dark Incantation Scroll** _(Allows a one-time casting of Circle of Death.)_

#### If the PCs come back to the Mortuary for more answers

- *Back again? I figured you might be. What is it this time? You still lookin’ for your lost barmy? Or have you decided to start your own collection of corpses?"*
- *"Told you before, didn’t I? Eliath’s gone. Once they go through the flames, there’s not much left to dig through—not unless you got a way to talk to ash."*
- *"You’re asking a lot of questions. That makes folks nervous. Me? I don’t mind—I don’t have much left to lose. But others? They might not be so patient."*

#### If they Capture/corner her

- *"You think you’ve won? You think you’re stoppin’ anything? You poor, clueless sods."*
- *"You’re fightin’ a war you don’t understand. You can break my bones, cutter, but you’ll never break the Reverie."*
