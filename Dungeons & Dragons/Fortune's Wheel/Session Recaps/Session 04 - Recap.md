PCs woke up from their restful nap prior to facing [[Shadowknave]] for the first time. Zill managed to interrogate one of his hirelings, connecting the mystery to the Mortuary, speaking to Toranna about Eliath. 

The barman advised the group that to call out Parissa's tout agency, called **Obsidian Eye Network**, they would have to throw 3 greens towards any surface, in order to make a sound. With such sound, one would be able to call out one of agency's touts. However, what he didn't inform them was that in order to successfully call this agency, one should generate a specific sound with the coins, a certain tempo. Zill successfully produced such sound after some attempts and [[Xamon_tout.png|Xamos]] arrived. 

PCs first stop was at Styx Oarsman, to let Orianna meet [[Valyndra.webp|Valyndra]].
Valyndra demanded from her warlock to accomplish the mission: to invade the [[Original Sin Cartel|Cartel]]. Orianna felt anxious about completing such a grand mission, troubled by the fact that her contract did not switched patrons as she remembered from her dream. 
Orianna's quest is to travel to Pazunia, the first layer of the Abyss, and into the tavern called Bucket of Blood. There she should meet a **certain individual** (might by another PC), acclimatizing her with the Cartel. 

Afterwards, the party travelled to the Mortuary. They didn't acquire any new information from Toranna, who didnt provide any new information, aside from the fact that Eliath has been cremated a couple of days ago. A week ago the [[The Collectors.webp|Collectors]] brought Eliath. The Mortuary keeps the barmies for a couple of days, to wait if any loved one of the victim wishes for a proper burial. If that doesn't happen, the Dustmen throw the bodies into the Elemental Plane of Fire.
PCs are not aware of the double sided nature of Toranna.

LO has also reunited with [[Bob, not a Blob Anymore]]. LO was in disbelief. After chit chatting for a bit, Bob let LO know that he's here for him and would help him, if his position allows that, in disentangling this mystery. Moreover, Bob mentioned the existence of the [[The Church of Experiments]], but didn't go into details. Skall, the factol of the Dustmen, keeps Bob occupied in the Mortuary.
