After years of fruitless searching, the truth about your parents' disappearance was finally revealed to you on a cold night in Baldur’s Gate. Over a hot mead and amidst drunken whispers, the truth was laid bare before you. It wasn’t the result of a grand conspiracy or a hidden plot orchestrated by powerful figures, as you had long believed. No, it was a small, insignificant gang of petty criminals who, in their desperation, had murdered your beloved fathers, Dory and Tomas, during a botched robbery. You traced this evidence back to some farmers who had seen their bodies discarded into a river, their deaths unnoticed and unavenged.

That night, you decided to visit the river yourself. "This can’t be it," you muttered, "it’s too simple, too common." You had thought that uncovering the truth would bring you closure or purpose, but instead, it left you hollow, unsure if they had been alive all along. Perhaps it was a hopeless thought, a desperate clinging to some semblance of hope.
The river ran still through the plains outside Baldur’s Gate, the air around you growing colder and colder—unnaturally so. The moon, which had been casting a pale glow over the scene, was suddenly obscured by a dark, swirling mist. Out of this mist, a figure began to materialize—a towering, ominous presence with glowing red eyes and a form that seemed to shift between a menacing shadow and a monstrous entity.

The entity spoke, its voice vibrating with barely contained malice, addressing you directly. "Hello, Zill. It seems your longing for justice in a world that often denies it to those most in need has brought me to you. Now, let’s see."

With a mere thought, the entity summoned two young men, clad in rags and likely stolen boots. "Let’s pretend that these two sods killed your beloved fathers." They appeared before you, frozen in terror, unable to move or speak. You, too, found yourself paralyzed, unable to act or even comprehend the situation fully.

The entity began to slowly and methodically torture them before your eyes, each scream and cry echoing in the darkness. The deaths of these two men were brutal and horrific, far worse than anything you could have imagined. You had fantasized about taking revenge on those who killed your parents, imagining the worst-case scenario and preparing yourself for the possibility of murder. But this—this was the work of a professional, a sadist.
Blood spilled across the ground, and their lifeless bodies collapsed at your feet.

The entity turned to you and asked, each question louder than the last, "Now that they are dead, what will you do, Zill? What becomes of your resolve, your stubbornness for answers? Was this enough to satisfy your thirst for justice, Adrian?"

Before you could even begin to form a response, the entity continued, its tone growing more insidious. "I can sense your rage, your pain, your hunger for more. Why stop here? There are countless others who prey on the weak, who escape justice—corrupt politicians, ruthless bandits, vile murderers, perverse predators. Let me help you find them, Zill. Let me guide you, empower you, and together we can make the world tremble!"

The entity stepped closer, its voice lowering to a whisper that seeped into your very soul. "All I ask in return is a small favor... a simple act of allegiance. Nothing comes without a price, after all, right? Think of what you could achieve, Zill. Think of the power you could wield."

As the scene and memory began to fade, time seemed to dilute and lose meaning. You awoke in a small tavern in the Hive Ward of an alien city—the center of the multiverse, Sigil.
