# Two Scales of the Same Story
*Truth is not a foundation; it is a story. And if it is a story, it can be rewritten*

The Reverie are a humanized, low-scale reflection of the Overlords (the modrons) that govern the broader, broken narrative of this campaign. Both groups wield the power to alter perception and reality, but their methods, limitations, and awareness differ significantly.

## The Reverie: Architects of Individual Rebirth

- The human equivalent of the Overlords, the Reverie operate at a social and psychological scale, reshaping people’s identities and beliefs rather than the entire story of existence.
- They believe reality is dictated by belief, and by manipulating belief, they can give lost souls a new truth, a second chance—whether they asked for one or not.
- The Reverie subtly rewrite the history of individuals—people who were once barmies, outcasts, or failures become something else, their old selves erased and replaced with a curated identity that better serves their new purpose.
- Their leader, Veylith, is a conductor of controlled myth-making, shaping individuals into something more useful to the world, whether they realize it or not.


## The Overlords: Architects of a Fractured Story

- The Overlords (modrons telling this story) function on a **multiversal** scale, inadvertently **rewriting** and **corrupting** reality itself as they struggle to recount the truth.
- Unlike the Reverie, they do not control belief intentionally—they are **imperfect historians**, constantly misremembering, altering, and re-editing the “facts” as they attempt to reconstruct a broken narrative.
- While the Reverie are deliberate architects, the Overlords are accidental manipulators—their errors shape existence, and the PCs are trapped within these inconsistencies.

### How they Mirror Each Other

- Both are rewriting the past—the Reverie do it with intention, the Overlords do it by mistake.
- Both create “new truths”—the Reverie for individuals, the Overlords for reality itself.
- Both erase past identities—but for what purpose?
- Both pose a moral dilemma—if belief shapes reality, is reshaping it truly a crime?
- Both represent a fundamental question—"If reality can be changed, who gets to decide what is real?"

Finally, the question remains:
*Is the world broken, or is it simply being rewritten into a better version of itself?*

### The Eternal Boundary

- Offers a way to ground players in Sigil, while feeding into the broader theme of reality and belief.
- The false deaths and rebirths in this module create the perfect parallel to the PCs' affliction, tricking them into thinking they might be dealing with the same mystery - until the rug is pulled out from under them.
- The false hope of an answer followed by the realization that their affliction is something else entirely will hit hard and drive them deeper into the story.
- The Reverie stands as the faction behind the Eternal Boundary's resurrection scheme, making them a philosophical counterpoint to the glitching reality.
	- Are the PCs simply victims of this same philosophy on a cosmic scale?
	- They are philosophically dangerous - what is reality if belief can reshape it? If the past can be overwritten?
	- Could the Overlords merely by applying the same philosophy at an incomprehensibly larger scale?
