The Hive is a sprawling slum of nameless streets that wind about like worms, and crowded tenements that run like rat burrows for hundreds of yards.

When the players first enter the Hive, read the following:

*The Hive sprawls around, surrounding you in a gray warren of run-down buildings, filthy streets, and desperate people. The cold drizzle has driven many of the street people to shelter. Condemned building glow with the red light of cooking fires and haggard faces peer at your from almost every window. The streets have a maddening tendency to confuse your senses of direction. From time to time, you're accosted by various people - stinking bubbers, raving barmies, street urchins looking for a handout, peddlers trying to sell their wares. You stumble across a number of businesses, including cheap alehouses, ratty inns, gaming halls and decrepit pawnshops. The shopkeepers are suspicious and watch you silently. *

### The Dancing Man

While the PCs are moving around in the Hive, they meet the [[Dancing Man.webp | Dancing Man]], a barmy of the first order. 

*You are walking down a straight, wide street of the Hive, chasing a rumor. It's still cold, and the rain is coming down in gray sheets. Ahead of you a tall, red-haired man in a battered, brown waistcoat appears, reeling and bounding. His long limbs jig up and down like drunken spiders. As he approaches, you hear him muttering under his breath, "Baphomet, Pazrael, Fraz Urblu . . . Juiblex . . . Laogzed, of course, Laogzed . . . Zuggtmoy!" The Dancing Man suddenly stops and begins screaming, "I tell you, I've seen, I've seen! The flies take your mind!" After his outburst, the man starts chanting names again and lurches away.*

If the PCs try to restrain the Dancing Man in any way, he turns on them with berserk fury and attacks unarmed. He possesses the strength of a maniac. The Dancing Man doesn't answer any questions, but instead recites the names of Abyssal powers over and over (and over and over ...) again.

As soon as the Dancing Man gets out of sight, stumbling down a dark alleyway, the Shadowknave and his men strike him and then retreat. Continue with the following text.

You hear a sudden shriek of "*No, get away from me! The flies — urkh!*"

The Dancing Man has been put under a feign death spell. The Collectors will show up and claim the body after a while, leading to the next encounter. If the PCs investigate the Dancing Man's cry, tell the players they find the man stone dead without a mark on him.

### The Collectors

In this encounter, the PCs discover another of the mysterious deaths plaguing the Hive. A group of wretched [[The Collectors.webp| Collectors]] are removing the remains of an unfortunate barmy. The Collectors are the lowest of Sigil's unclean, and members of this faction eke out a living by looting dead bodies and taking them to the Mortuary. The Dustmen pay them a pittance for saving them the trouble of transporting the deceased.

*Turning a corner, you come upon a group of six ragged men, dressed in the discarded clothes of wealthy folk. Their tattered clothes are somber black, and they carry themselves with a strange charade of dignity. The men are standing around the form of a bubber lying in the gutter. One nudges the fellow with his foot. "If he ain't dead, he's close enough," he says. "I say we collect 'im." Several men solemnly begin to loot the body, while another opens a dusty book and begins intoning, "0 whatever power this poor sod worship'd, look kindly upon the departed spirit of — anyone know this sod's name? - oh, well, the departed spirit o' your servant. Hey, is that a gold tooth he's got?"*

The Collectors are led by a down-on-his-luck thief called Mourner Tom. They're an unsavoury  lot, but they're not here for a fight. If the PCs threaten them or intervene, the Collectors protest ("Hey, we found 'im first! Go get your own deader, berk!") but offer no resistance. They flee if the PCs draw weapons against them.

The Collectors aren't averse to chatting with passersby while they work. If asked, they'll tell the PCs that an unusual number of bubbers and barmies have been dyin' off lately, with not a mark on them. "It's like they fall asleep and don't wake up," they say. "Very peaceful, that."

If the characters ask the Collectors about Eliath and provide a description, they confer for a moment. "We might've seen 'im, but our memory's none too good," hints Mourner Tom. With a little, ah, inducement from the PCs, Tom tells them, "We picked up a sod like that a while back, and took 'im to the Mortuary. Sorry to hear you were lookin' for him. If the Dustmen remember where they put im, you can always try magic to get ahold of 'is spirit."


### The Bleakers

[[Derioch Ysarl.webp | Derioch Ysarl]] of the Bleak Cabal is searching for the cause of the barmies' deaths. When she meets the PCs, she assumes that they are involved.

*While making inquiries in a nameless tavern, you are greeted with hard stares from four grimy laborers, a barkeep, and a serving maid, but people mind their own business in the Hive. A few minutes after you enter, six tough-looking cutters in the colors of the Bleak Cabal saunter in, and shoulder their way past the other customers to confront you. The leader is a gaunt human in wizard's robes. She surveys your group with a grim expression. "Tell us what you're doing in the Hive or you won't leave this tavern alive," she says. The other customers start moving aside.*

Derioch assumes that the PCs are the sods she's been looking for, but she'll give them a small chance to prove otherwise. If the PCs come clean with her and admit they're looking for a barmy, she relaxes a bit and talks. She's still suspicious, but with a little effort the PCs can convince her that they aren't responsible.

- *"You keep diggin', you're bound to find something rotten. The Hive's always been full of corpses, but this? This feels different. Like someone's clearing the board before the game even stars."*

##### The Cabal's Chant
If the PCs convince Derioch that they're not the sods she's looking for, she'll be willing to exchange information. In re- turn for the Bleakers' help in finding Eliath, Derioch wants the PCs to find out who's responsible for killing barmies in the Hive. Depending on how the negotiations go, use some or all of the following dialogue suggestions:

- *"You're looking for a barmy? We keep records of every sod who loses his mind in the Cage. Give me a day, and I'll see if we know of Eliath."*
- *"In return for our help, we want you to watch for anyone unusual in the Hive. I'll be in [[Fiend's Salute Tavern || Salute]] at nightfall every night. If you see anything worth passing on, meet me there."*


### A Shadow in Sigil

Regardless of how the PCs' search for Eliath goes, they'll run into the [[Shadowknave.webp || Shadowknave]] and his gang before they leave the Hive Quarter.

*Night is falling over the Hive, and the lurid light of hundreds of cooking fires can be seen dancing in the ruins and slums. The rain has stopped, but the air's cold and damp. You are making your way down a dismal street, heading for a tavern for some dinner and companionship, when you hear a faint cry from a dark alley nearby: "Hey, get off me, you berk! Get awa — aghk!"*

If the PCs investigate, read the following to the players.

*You find four bashers restraining a bubber just out of sight of the street. A roguish half-elf wearing black leather armor supervises their efforts, a sinister smile on his face. As you continue to watch, the half-elf casts a spell, and the bubber sags back in his captors' arms without a sound. The half-elf steps forward, checks the fellow, and says, "He's out. Let's put him closer to the street so the Collectors'll find him." The bashers drag the fellow toward the street.*

The Shadowknave and his hire swords don't want the dark of their activities to get out, and if the PCs make their presence known, the Knave orders his bashers to attack. He assists them by using sleep and slow spells. They'll fight until two of the bashers or the Knave are down, and then they'll withdraw. The Knave uses his wand offer to cover their retreat. He'll abandon his men, if necessary.

None of the Knave's bashers know the scheme; they were hired as guards by the magician. They only know their job is to restrain barmies while the Knave casts spells on them. However, if the Knave is captured and questioned, he tells the PCs that he is working for the Dustmen, hoping to mislead them into attacking the Mortuary.
