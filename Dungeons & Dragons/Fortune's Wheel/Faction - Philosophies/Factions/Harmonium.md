*Who Enforce Peace through Might*

![[FactionHarmonium5e.webp | 300]]

**Factol**: Sarin

**Headquarters**: Barracks

**Aligned Plane**: Arcadia

**Members**: Authoritarians, guards, mediators

**Epithet**: Hardheads

The Harmonium looks at existence and sees only two states: war and peace. Where neighbors share the same views, there’s peace—the perfect state of the multiverse—but disagreements breed conflict and instability. Members of the Harmonium believe their purpose is to unify the multiverse into peace, no matter the cost.

The Harmonium seeks to eliminate discord by any means necessary. Hardheads use education and enforcement to convert others to their philosophy, extolling the virtues of peace as they crack down on chaos in all its forms.

Many members are good-natured protectors who protect all citizens, even those who disagree with the faction’s philosophy. However, some among the ranks pursue unity at any cost. Cruel martinets who earn the Hardheads their nickname, they enforce laws ruthlessly, without flexibility or compassion.

Factol Sarin (lawful neutral, human Harmonium captain) commands the Harmonium. His devotion to his fellows, particularly new recruits, is renowned, and he takes a personal interest in all members who cross his path. Tough as steel, Sarin is a decisive factol who promotes honor, dignity, and peace in word and deed.

**Faction Attire**. Most Hardheads wear the faction’s standard-issue armor, a distinctive suit of red plate with bladed pauldrons. Under their helms, they sport short, no-nonsense hairstyles.

**Role in Sigil**. In the Barracks, Hardheads train, plan patrol routes, and keep records of every arrest in the Cage. The Harmonium works closely with the Fraternity of Order and the Mercykillers as Sigil’s tripartite of justice, cycling criminals through arrest, trial, and punishment. They staunchly oppose the Hands of Havoc and others who defy authority.

## "Move Along, Berk, Nothing to See Here"

The Harmonium are usually touchy when you start asking questions. More often than not they’ll try to clap you in _planar mancatchers if you start trying to record their speeches into mimirs. Nobody really knows why the law-enforcing faction of Sigil’s so jumpy these days, but there are plenty of wild theories.

Some cutters reckon the Hardheads are worried they’ll be displaced from Sigil when the next sect with enough power challenges them. See, the Harmonium are a pretty new faction as these things go, and they haven’t had so much time to build up power bases on the planes as other groups. Add to this the fact they’re making themselves pretty unpopular by enforcing the laws of the Cage, and you come up with a pretty grim conclusion…perhaps the Hardheads think they’re an easy target.

A casual observer would probably laugh at this notion, after all, the Harmonium are the most prominent faction in the Cage, especially now they’ve established a secondary headquarters in the Hive (as **SIGIS** reports). But some touts reckon they’re spreading themselves a bit thin. The **Communals**, the **Expansionists** and the **Ring-Givers** all have their greedy eyes on the Cage, and any one of ’em is a potential threat to the Harmonium. 

Perhaps this is why, as the dark whispers go, the Harmonium are trying to weaken other factions on the sly. Many a rumour’s gone round the Harmonium are actively trying to drive the **Indeps** out of the Cage by harassment and persecution. It seems to be working…there are fewer Free Leaguers hanging around the **Bazaar** these days, anyone will confirm.

Or perhaps the Harmonium are worried about something else. Strange things have been happening on **Arcadia**, recently. Berk, it’s a gossipmonger’s paradise…
