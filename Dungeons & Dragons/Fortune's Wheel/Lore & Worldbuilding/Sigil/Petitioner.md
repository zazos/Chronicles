### What _is_ a petitioner?

- **A soul that’s already reached the afterlife.** When a mortal dies, its spirit finally settles on the Outer Plane whose alignment—or patron deity—best matches it. There it manifests as an _idealised_ but usually low-powered body called a petitioner. 
- **Plane-locked.** Because their essence is now part of the Outer Planes’ fabric, petitioners physically _can’t_ leave the Outer Planes. Ordinary _plane shift_ or portals that jump to the Material, Inner or Transitive Planes simply fizzle for them. [
- **Hard to resurrect, easy to obliterate.** Only _true resurrection_ or _wish_ brings one back to mortal life; if a petitioner is slain it reforms after 100 years (or merges with its plane forever). 
- **Little or no memory of the life before.** Most forget everything but hazy emotions; only extraordinary cases (proxies, story-relevant uniques like Morte) retain detailed memories.


| Feature                  | Planar Mortal (living “cager”, tiefling, githzerai, etc.) | Petitioner (after-life soul)                                                           |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Alive?**               | Yes; born on an Outer Plane—or long-term resident.        | No; already died once.                                                                 |
| **Can travel anywhere?** | Yes, with the right portal or spell.                      | No—restricted to Outer Planes because of _plane-locked_.                               |
| **Resurrection**         | Normal D&D spells apply.                                  | Only _true resurrection_ or _wish_; otherwise reforms after 100 yrs on its home plane. |
| **Advancement**          | Levels, XP, and new abilities as usual.                   | Cannot gain class levels unless elevated (proxy, exalted, etc.).                       |
| **Memories**             | Full life experience.                                     | Typically wiped or dream-like fragments.                                               |
| **Game term**            | “Planar” (or “planar mortal”)—still a _creature_.         | “Petitioner”—now a Celestial/Fiend subtype.                                            |
|                          |                                                           |                                                                                        |
### Why do you meet petitioners in Sigil at all?

- **Sigil is still an Outer-Plane locale.** The City of Doors floats above the Outlands’ Spire, so being in Sigil doesn’t violate the _plane-locked_ clause. 
- **Portals go both ways.** A petitioner might drift through a doorway keyed to somewhere in Sigil—often recruited by factions (Dustmen love a philosophical “deader”).
- **“Lost and wandering” souls.** Canon explicitly allows petitioners that get _waylaid_ or “make new homes elsewhere on the Great Wheel.” A few inevitably wash up in the Cage’s streets and taverns. [
- **Lady-of-Pain’s neutrality.** Powers themselves can’t enter, but their former worshippers can; the Lady doesn’t care unless a body starts trouble.

> “*Hush now. Even the souls of saints find their way to the Cage; belief’s a crooked road.*” — Skall, Bleaker priest
