[Static crackles, followed by an electronically distorted voice]

"Listen close, rust-for-brains: the target isn't some random sod. We're talking Church-grade salvage. The client wants it discreet, but there's chatter that this one's different—a leftover from that old burn-job in the Master's lab. You know the rules: if it's Church tech, don't ask questions, just bring back the parts. But here's the twist—they don't want it whole; just broken enough to drag back breathing and kicking.

Something about debugging, whatever the Abyss that means.

You've got your orders. And don't screw this up. The Church pays well, but their patience is about as thin as our tolerance for bureaucracy. Any problems, and the Forgemasters won’t be happy."

[Another voice interjects briefly, quieter, more human but equally distorted]

"This thing we're hunting... rumor has it the Master himself tinkered with it. Watch your back—I've seen what his gear can do."

[The message abruptly ends with another burst of static]
