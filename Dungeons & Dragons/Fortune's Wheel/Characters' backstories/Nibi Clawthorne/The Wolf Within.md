## Setting the Scene

[Play this as background](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox3laUdQsn8&list=RDOx3laUdQsn8&start_radio=1)

*As you (Nibi) drift into uneasy sleep, the world around you dissolves into a haze of shadow and cold, metallic echoes. The air is thick with the scent of antiseptic and old blood, pierced by the distant, rhythmic clatter of chains. The darkness is broken only by flickering, artificial lights—harsh, sterile, and tinged with a sickly blue.*

*You find yourself standing in a corridor of impossible length, its walls lined with glass tubes and humming machinery. The floor is slick, reflecting the pale glow of containment runes. Each step you take echoes with the memory of countless others—bare feet, claws, and the shuffle of chained limbs.*

*A low growl reverberates through the air, not threatening, but mournful. Your white wolf appears, spectral and immense, her fur streaked with grime and her eyes haunted by memories not entirely her own.*

> You see what they made of us. Not beast, not man—something between. They called it progress. I remember the cold. The pain. The taste of iron and fear.

As the Wolf speaks, fracture images flash before you in this corridor, like echoes lingering:
- A surgical table, restraints biting into fur and flesh.
- **[[masked_figure_church.webp|A masked figure]]**—scribbling notes as arcane energy crackles through a glass tube.
- A second wolf, smaller, with a coat of dark grey, eyes wild with terror. The white and the dark grey wolf, side by side, separated by a wall of shimmering force.
- The sound of a voice, distorted by intercom static:
> Subject V-1: compliant. Subject Beta-7: unstable. Begin phase separation

*The Wolf's form flickers, her chains rattling as she lowers her head towards you*

> There was another. My kin. We ran together in the dark, before the pain. I do not know where he is now. I feel only emptiness where his howl once answered mine.

A surge of emotion—loss, longing, and a fierce, protective rage—courses through Nibi, not entirely her own.

> They tried to break us. To make us weapons, tools. But you… you are different. You listen. Through you, I feel more than a tool. More than a curse. 

A final vision flashes:

*A containment cell, empty but for a single, bloodstained collar. The faintest echo of a howl, cut short.*

> If you find him—if you find any of us—remember: we are not monsters.
