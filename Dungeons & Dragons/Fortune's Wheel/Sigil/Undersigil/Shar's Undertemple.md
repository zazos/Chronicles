# Underwater Mausoleum: The Enveris Family Crypt

*Beneath the murky, cold waters of the sunken canal lies a small, hill-like rise—a submerged mausoleum barely a dozen coffin plates wide. Some plates are cracked and broken, their inscriptions worn away by time and water; others remain steady, bearing the faded names of the noble Enveris family. At the center stands the family crypt, a stone sarcophagus sealed but partially overgrown with algae.*

*The crypt seems almost alive, shrouded in an eerie glow where strands of algae pulse faintly with an otherworldly light. Within this tangled growth lies the sigil-sealed ring, its metal glinting faintly beneath the water’s surface.*

*Near the crypt, two ancient coffins lie jammed open, their lids shifted askew as if pried by unseen hands. From these open tombs emanates a strange, vibrating energy—an unstable portal shimmering faintly with dark hues. The air here tastes of cold void and forgotten sorrow.* 
(One of these portals opens into a desolate, shadow-haunted plane, twisted by the influence of Shar herself)

*Guarding the crypt is a weathered stone statue, cracked and worn by centuries underwater. Though it is clearly not sentient, bubbles rise steadily from its hollow eye sockets, as if the statue itself breathes beneath the waves. The bubbles drift upward, bursting silently on the water’s surface.*


## Dream Sequences: Visions of the Enveris Legacy

**Vision 1: The Ceremony of the First Murder**

*You find yourself kneeling before a shadowed figure draped in a veil of darkness. The air is thick with whispered promises and cold dread. The figure’s voice is a hiss:*
> *“Hide me in darkness, and I shall offer you my light.”*


**Vision 2: The Betrayal at the Banquet**

*A grand hall filled with noble faces, all gathered in celebration. As goblets raise, the wine turns black as ink. Suddenly, a hand clamps around a mother’s throat, strangling her silently. The ring slips from her finger, claimed by the betrayer.*
*In a chilling twist, you see yourself seated at the table—wearing the face of the traitor.*

**Vision 3: The Face of Shar**

*The algae blooms violently, petals parting to reveal a void where a face should be—the empty, consuming presence of Shar. A voice, cold and seductive, whispers:*
> *“Your light is mine, if you are willing to forget.”*
