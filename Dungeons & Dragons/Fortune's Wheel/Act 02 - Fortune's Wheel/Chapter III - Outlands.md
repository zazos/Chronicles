# Chapter III: Into the Outlands

## Arrival

*You find yourself standing amid ruins of weathered black marble. The last recognisable remnant of these ruins, a solitary stone archway, provides a frame for the portal you just passed through. Glittering, deep-blue sand spreads before you in all directions. Great impact divots mark the passage of something enormous. The trail leads toward a sudden transition in the terrain, where a forest of magenta trees climbs craggy hills that look like wizened faces. Much farther in the distance, an impossibly tall stone spire stretches from the horizon into the clouds.*

The portal from Sigil opens into a nameless ruin in the Outlands that is roughly halfway between the Spire and the gate-town of Torch. This gate-town can be seen in the horizon as immense bridge-like structures loom over the region.

*In the distance, you see the gate-town of Torch—a jagged cluster of volcanic spires rising from a blood-red marsh, their blackened slopes veined with glowing rivers of molten rock. Immense bridge-like structures arc between the spires, linking walled districts perched high above the pestilent swamps below. Even from here, the air seems to shimmer with heat, and a faint, ruddy glow bathes the town in perpetual twilight as plumes of smoke twist skyward.*

The portal, which leads back to Sigil is no longer active and evaporates in the air. The surreal nature of the surrounding desert, forest, and hills, as well as the rapid transition between the terrains, is natural for the Outlands. Following the trail is easy and leads towards the magenta forest.

## The Walking Castle: Iedcaru

*Amid a grove of strange trees stands an ornate tower. Around it, toppled pillars lie scattered. A short stairway rises from the ground to a stone terrace, where six openings lead into the structure.*

[[walking_castle_land.webp|Show To Players]]

The walking castle, Iedcaru, is a treasure from ages past. It was created by githzerai as a hermitage where ascetics could travel the Outlands and meditate on the nature of realms beyond. While the castle has been forgotten by most githzerai scholars in Limbo, it remains the home of [[Zaythir]], a sage who seeks to glean multiversal truths from mystical planar forces.

Iedcaru has recently seen more visitors than usual. The first was the modron R04M, which stopped at the castle and learned much about the Outlands. More recently, though, a host of Fiends discovered and occupied the castle. They’ve captured [[Zaythir]] and are now working to discover how to operate the castle. The fiends are seeking to claim the castle and sell it as a war machine. They are not associated with Shemeshka at all.

#### W1: Terrace
*A paved ring with a 2-foot-high lip provides a foundation for the castle. The base of the tower opens into a hall without exterior doors. Along the west and east interior walls of this hall are doors that lead inside (W2).*
- The door to the east is locked. 
- The door to the west has been shattered inward.

#### W2: Library
[[walking_castle_main_entrance.webp|Show To Players]]
*All manner of tomes, scrolls, tablets, and folios cram the towering shelves of this airy library. An ancient wooden table surrounded by matching benches stands at the room’s center, near an ornate spiral staircase that climbs through the ceiling above. To the north are statues of githzerai scholars and an alcove with a table covered in candles. To the south, in another alcove, stands a crystal sarcophagus.*

The library holds the collected writings of Iedcaru’s scholars. The majority focus on esoteric philosophies of the Outer Planes and multiversal theories. The spiral stairs rise to area W3.
- **North Alcove:** This alcove holds two braziers, a threadbare mat, and a table covered in candles and used incense sticks.
- **Sarcophagus:** Visible through the transparent lid of this sarcophagus is the mummified body of Iedcaru’s first caretaker, the githzerai scholar [[Laxuelu.webp]], whose name is etched on the lid. The mummy has brass eyes, and its sarcophagus can’t be opened. Whenever a creature in the library speaks its desire for a text on a particular topic, the mummy’s eyes magically move to look in the direction of a relevant work in the collection (if it exists).
- **Treasure:** Among the candles in the alcove sits a partially melted candle of invocation of a random alignment that has 1 hour of use remaining.

#### W3: Main Room
*A spiral staircase emerges through the floor into this multi-use kitchen and social area. To the north, a ladder ascends to the floor above, and six simple doors ring the room. To the west are several cabinets and cooking spaces that have been pillaged, with pots and foodstuffs scattered across the floor. Two tieflings in spiked armor conspire over the table.*

The tieflings are neutral evil gladiators in the service of [[Thlaarsh, the Gore Drinker|Thlaarsh]] (see area W5). They’re hostile, but a character who succeeds on a DC 18 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check or who offers each tiefling at least 1,000 gp convinces the pair to betray their yugoloth allies. Otherwise, the tieflings scream battle cries as they fight to the death. If the characters don’t silence the tieflings quickly, the Fiends in areas W5, W6, and W7 are alerted.
- **Supplies:** The kitchen has been plundered, but 14 days of rations remain. These mostly consist of pickled radishes—a favorite of Zaythir’s.

#### W4: Bedrooms
- **W4a:** This room has a single bed, a desk, and a cabinet containing loose robes.
- **W4b:** This room has two beds, a writing desk, and an empty cabinet.
- **W4c:** This room contains a large nest, once used by an avian scholar, and a cabinet with clothes suited for a winged wearer. A door to the east opens onto a sturdy log perch covered in old talon scratches.

#### W5: Study
*A sizeable desk stands opposite the door in this stuffy study. Cabinets, crowded bookshelves, and maps of the Outer Planes cover the room’s walls. In the south corner stands a simple cot. A hulking, green-skinned figure with mighty wings and razor-sharp claws violently peruses the books, discarding those that displease it.*

This is Zaythir’s study. The nycaloth [[Thlaarsh, the Gore Drinker]] is here, seeking ways to make the castle move. Thlaarsh attacks rival trespassers and fights to the death, but it tries to capture spellcasters, hoping to make them pilot the castle.
- **Treasure:** The desk holds [[Zaythir|Zaythir’s]] notes on the Outlands, which are written in Gith, as well as calligrapher's supplies. On the desk is a broken [[Mimir Knowledge|Mimir]] with a skull made of colourful glass shards.

#### W6: Castellan Chamber
*This chamber is dominated by a sculpture of a gigantic, humanlike figure looming over a broad, circular table. A ladder to the north descends, while a ladder to the south climbs to the floor above. Three four-armed, insectile creatures inspect the sculpture and table, trying to break them loose.*
- **[[Iadecaru_castellan.webp|Castellan]]:** The statue and table here are together a unique magical being known as the Castellan. It is dormant when the characters initially enter this room.
- **Secret Door:** A character who investigates the south wall and succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds a secret door that slides open. In this space is a small table on which sit several candles and a **necklace of prayer beads** with 1d4 + 2 magic beads.

#### W7: Meditation Chamber
*Ancient tapestries of the planes and cosmic alignments cover the walls of this simple room. Ladders descend to the floor below and rise to the level above.*

#### W8: Signal Tower
*Narrow windows look out from this stark stone chamber in every direction. In the room’s center stands a green crystal atop a stone pillar. A ladder descends to the floor below. Seated in a corner is a githyanki woman with long, white hair and closed eyes.*
The Fiends have kept the castle’s caretaker, a neutral githzerai uniter named **Zaythir**, in this chamber. Zaythir is eager to be free and evict the devils from her home.
- **Crystal:** The green crystal affixed to the pedestal is a gem of brightness. When the gem is lit, its light can be seen over a mile away.

### Castle Inhabitants & Resolution
Once the Fiends are defeated and Zaythir is freed, the characters have access to the walking castle and the gratitude of its residents.
- **The Castellan:** Zaythir can reactivate this magical wonder. It understands Common and Gith and controls the castle's movements (12 mph). It is friendly to those who rescued Zaythir.
- **Zaythir:** A githzerai uniter who has lived in the castle for over a century. She is grateful and offers the use of the castle, guidance through the Outlands, and knowledge of how to operate the Castellan.
- **Laxuelu:** The mummy in the sarcophagus is a powerful githzerai scholar who can be consulted once per day for information on the planes, magic items, or history (DC 14 Int/Religion check to communicate).

## Side Quest: The Time Dragon

This encounter can happen at any point while the characters are residing in the walking castle.

### An Old Friend
There’s a boom and the castle sags. If a character investigates, they see a mighty, pearl-colored **adult time dragon** coiled atop the castle.

> *“My old friend. How good it is to see you again.”*

This is **Renesnuprah**. She claims to know the characters from a meeting hundreds of years in their future. Realizing her mistake, she gives them a **talisman of the sphere** and says, *“Give this to the one who sees silver,”* before departing.

### A New Friend
Later, a panicked **cerulean time dragon wyrmling** barrels toward the castle, pursued by a witch on a flying broom.
The wyrmling is **Renesnuprah** (Reenee), reduced to 10 HP. The witch is **Trikante**, an archmage who purchased Reenee in Ribcage for experiments and wants her "property" back.
- **Trikante's Deal:** Trikante will trade for the wyrmling. If the characters offer a magic item, she removes her mirrored goggles, revealing **eyes like silver pools**. She will accept a legendary item, such as the **talisman of the sphere**.
- **Conflict:** If attacked, Trikante is a formidable foe but will flee if reduced to 50 HP or fewer.
- **Resolution:** If saved, Reenee is grateful but doesn't know the way home. Zaythir can identify her home as the **Mausoleum of Chronepsis**.

### Journey to the Mausoleum
When the characters near the Mausoleum, Reenee asks them to stop, knowing the dragons there are territorial. She thanks the party and gifts them one of her scales before flying off. The scale transforms into a **Charm of the Time Dragon**. As they depart, an ancient Renesnuprah appears in a portal and says, 
> *“Call, and I’ll be there.”*
