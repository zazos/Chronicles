>*The beast is inefficient. The curse is crude. We will refine it - or erase it.*

## Project *V-HELOX* Initiative

Internally, the Church referred to the project as V-HELOX: "Voluntary Hybridized Evolutionary Lupomorphism for Operative Xenoadaptivity."

Forged in the labs of the Church of Experiments, Lycanoside was the name given to an artificial strain of lycanthropy. The goal was to engineer the perfect werewolf through forced ingestion and arcane-biological augmentation by isolating the wolf-entity from the host and bind it to artificial nerve-lattices. 

They failed. The procedure did not purge the curse–it killed the host, leaving the inner beast untethered and insane. These werewolves, now stripped of their human restraint became known as Rogue Howls.

> "It speaks to you in dreams. It remembers things you do not. It wants you to survive–but not as you are."

### The Rogue Howls

The Church, viewing these creatures as irredeemable waste experiments, discarded them across the planes—either through planar gating or controlled "leaks" into war zones.

#### Manifestation:

- Begins like traditional lycanthropy: affliction by bite or blood.
- Rapid mutation within days, not weeks.
- Body heals unnaturally fast, even before full transformation.
- Strange dreams—visions of labs, sterile halls, broken machines.

#### Unique Features:

- **Cognitive Lupomorphism** – The wolf spirit is sentient and parasitic.
- **Echo Memories** – Flashes of the Church's labs, failed experiments, and even other cursed victims. Players may "remember" events they never experienced.
- **Planar Residue** – The strain bleeds traces of Mechanus, Carceri, or Baator—depending on the test batch. Effects may include flickering realities, mechanical instincts, or violent outbursts from suppressed memories.

## The Tamed Howl: Subject V-1 "Obedient Beast"

One Rogue Howl was successfully pacified.
Under the control of Fabricator-Lord Kazan Vel, this werewolf has been fully bound to neurothaumic chains, obeying commands like a trained weapon.

>The Prototype walks on elongated legs reinforced with iron-tendon grafts.
>Its body is torn between fur and bolted steel, with chemical cannisters embedded in its spine.
>A collar of containment tech surrounds its throat, occasionally sparking when it begins to sniff for prey unsanctioned.


## Nibi Clawthorne

One of these discarded Rogue Howls, a wretched, unstable vessel, escaped containment and bit a civilian. Nibi Clawthorne got bit, but she survived. Something within her awoke. 
Nibi is one of the few known **Symbiotics**—those who have formed a mutual understanding with the wolf. Instead of dominance, there is union. 

- The Lycanocide strain, passed down naturally (rather than intravenously or forcefully), retains the full spirit of the original beast.
- In Nibi, that wolf is sentient. Perhaps even merging with her.
- This phenomenon was never predicted by the Church, which assumed transmission would dilute or destabilize the curse. 

Nibi is the living proff that Lycanocide is not static – it evolves.

> **Status:** **Free-roaming**  
> **Priority:** _Extreme_  
> **Directive:** _Capture if possible. Erase if not._


## Some Plot Hooks

- Nibi may encounter fragmented memories of the Prototype–the wolf within may recognize kinship. These wolves were raised in the same laboratory after all.
- The Church may use the Prototype to track her, bait her.
- The Wolf Inside: Gradually Nibi gains new abilities that Blood Hunters do not possess. She may be able to speak through or even merge with her inner wolf.
