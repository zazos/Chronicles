*You awaken on a metal examination table in a dim, windowless stone chamber. The air is cold and stale, tinged with the acrid sting of formaldehyde emanating from a nearby shelf of clouded asks and antiseptic jars. Dried blood stains the drab, mosaicked oor and the edges of your table, and pained moans haunt the halls beyond the stuffy room. A human skull oats nearby. It bobs impatiently, watching you with slate-gray eyes that remain in its lidless sockets. The skull notices you’re awake and greets you with a nasal voice. “Hey, Chief!”*

The talking skull is Morte, a curmudgeonly interplanar traveler plucked from his eternal punishment in the Nine Hells. Tormented by the lies he told in life, Morte masks his pain with a morbid sense of humour and an insufferable dose of sarcasm.

## Talking with Morte

Morte is friendly toward the characters and does his best to answer their questions. In conversation, the skull addresses each character as “Chief” or some other inoffensive but still unflattering nickname.

**Who Are You?** Morte describes himself as a debonair planes traveler who died too young. If asked about the whereabouts of his body, Morte quips he never really had a good head on his shoulders or claims to be the skull of the archlich Vecna. 

**Where Are We?** The characters are in the Mortuary in Sigil, an interplanar hub at the center of the Outer Planes. If they ever see the light of day again, they’re in for a real treat. 

**How Did We Get Here?** To have wound up in the Mortuary, Morte reckons the characters must’ve died and been wheeled in, just like everyone else. 

**How Do We Leave?** Morte doesn’t know the way out, but he does know the Heralds of Dust, who run the Mortuary, don’t take kindly to “fleshies” poking around. He tells the characters to “shake a leg” and make their escape while they still can

f the characters ask Morte to accompany them, the skull declines, mentioning that he’s waiting for someone else. He doesn’t elaborate further

## Mortuary Basement

The basement of the Mortuary is a collection of musty chambers where the Heralds of Dust, also known as the Dusters, process Sigil’s dead. Cheerless faction agents prowl its halls, wheeling corpses to embalming chambers or to the crematorium. The Heralds of Dust treat the dead with reverence and dignity, granting them last rites in accordance with the beliefs of the deceased whenever possible. Heralds of Dust abhor resurrection magic, decrying it as anathema to their work

**Ceilings.** Ceilings are 8 feet high in corridors and 12 feet high in rooms. They are held aloft by walls of smooth stone. 
**Doors.** Doors are iron gates that squeak as they swing on their hinges. 
**Lighting.** The basement is dimly lit by sputtering continual flame spells cast on wall sconces grasped by iron skeletal hands.

### M1: Morgue

Bolted into the oor are eight examination tables, and rusty furnishings—step stools, garbage cans, and metal gurneys—are scattered between them. Humanoid bodies, draped in dingy sheets ecked with blood, lie on any tables not occupied by the characters when they wake. Deceased commoners collected from Sigil, the corpses carry nothing of value.

**Treasure.** The shelf along the far wall contains a healer’s kit with three uses remaining, several asks of embalming chemicals, a polished scalpel that functions as a dagger, and any equipment the characters begin play with.


### M2: Autopsy Room

*This sterile chamber reeks of embalming fluids. A mortician in a bloodstained apron hunches over a humanoid amalgam of patchwork flesh. Elbow deep in its flayed- open chest with a pair of surgical instruments, this grim doctor causes the corpselike creature to twitch and writhe with her movements.*

Jex, a wispy-haired Heralds of Dust remnant, dissects a esh golem in the autopsy room. The cold-hearted mortician is trying to locate a key she accidentally dropped inside the golem during a routine grafting procedure.

Becoming one of the faction’s undertakers after a failed attempt at lichdom, Jex drank from a magical goblet that burned away her jaw. Her features have since been reconstructed with translucent wax. If either creature becomes aware of the characters, the golem sits up—its exposed chest cavity on display—and the horrified mortician tells the characters they’re supposed to be dead. Both creatures attack.

**Treasure.** The golem’s chest contains the key to the locked drawer in area M4.

### M3: Possessions Room

Αυτή η αποθήκη φιλοξενεί αντικείμενα που κατασχέθηκαν από τους νεκρούς. Δύο poltergeists (variant specter) ανέβασαν ένα μακάβριο κουκλοθέατρο για ένα κοινό τριών σκελετών με χαλαρό σαγόνι. Τα πνεύματα αιωρούνται πίσω από μια αυτοσχέδια κουρτίνα, χρησιμοποιώντας τα ακατάληπτα κλάματα τους για να δώσουν σε ένα ζευγάρι απόκοσμες κούκλες την εντύπωση του λόγου.

Τα poltergeists είναι αδιάφορα για τους χαρακτήρες, αλλά αν οι χαρακτήρες ενοχλούν την απόδοσή τους, τα poltergeists επιτίθενται και οι σκελετοί ενώνονται.

Ένας χαρακτήρας μπορεί να κάνει έναν έλεγχο DC 14 Charisma (Performance) για να δράσει μαζί με τις μαριονέτες. Σε έναν επιτυχημένο έλεγχο, οι σκελετοί χειροκροτούν και τα poltergeists ανταμείβουν τον χαρακτήρα με ένα potion of resistance (poison) από ένα μουσικό κουτί σε ένα ψηλό ράφι

**Θησαυρός**. Εκτός από το potion of resistance (poison), αυτό το δωμάτιο διαθέτει τρεις στολές φατριών (της επιλογής σας), ένα πορτοφόλι που περιέχει 30 gp και τρία μπιχλιμπίδι. 


This storage room houses objects confiscated from the dead. Two poltergeists (variant specters) put on a macabre puppet show for an audience of three slack-jawed skeletons. The spirits hover behind a makeshift curtain, using their unintelligible wails to give a pair of eerie dolls the impression of speech. 

The poltergeists are indifferent toward the characters, but if the characters disturb their performance, the poltergeists attack and the skeletons join in. If a character dies in this room and later returns, the poltergeists substitute the dolls for a dance routine featuring the character’s limp corpse as its star. 

A character can make a DC 14 Charisma (Performance) check to act alongside the puppets. On a successful check, the skeletons applaud, and the poltergeists reward the character with a potion of resistance (poison) from a music box on a high shelf. 

**Treasure.** In addition to the potion of resistance (poison), this room holds three faction uniforms (your choice), a purse containing 30 gp, and three trinkets (determined randomly by rolling on the Trinkets table in the Player’s Handbook).

### M4: Cold Locker

Six mortuary stretchers, chilled drawers sized for Medium creatures, line the walls of this frigid chamber. The Heralds of Dust store members of their Undead workforce here. 

The drawers and their contents are as follows:

**Drawer 1**. This drawer is jammed shut. A human commoner—a pasty-faced Herald of Dust named Fruth who fell asleep on the job and was mistakenly pronounced dead—bangs on the door from the inside, begging to be freed. The door can be opened with a successful DC 15 Strength check. If released, the shivering Herald of Dust is friendly toward the characters. However, it’s his first day, and he doesn’t know the way out of the Mortuary other than the way corpses come in: the chute in area M6.

**Drawers 2–4**. Each of these drawers contains a zombie worker that groans and shields its eyes if exposed to the light. If a character disturbs an occupant further, all three of the drawers swing open, and the zombies attack. 

**Drawer 5.** This drawer is empty. 

**Drawer 6.** This drawer is locked. Opening it requires a successful DC 18 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools or the key located in the autopsy room (area M2). Inside are a jewelled goblet worth 100 gp, a manifesto of the Heralds of Dust’s philosophies, and a spell scroll of animate dead.

### M5: Crematorium

*An ashy broom and dustpan lean against the wall outside a narrow corridor with an iron, windowed door. Two levers—a blue lever in the upward position and a red lever turned downward—are set into the walls adjacent to the door. An identical door stands closed at the end of the passageway.*

Centrally located, this crematorium is a 30-foot-long, 5-foot-wide chamber accessible by Undead workers on both ends. Miniature blowtorches are located in the mouths of stone faces that dot the walls of the chamber.

**Safety Lever (Blue).** To prevent flames from escaping into the hallway, a safety lever ensures the crematorium’s two entrances—iron doors with reinforced windows of heat-resistant glass—are shut while its flames spouts are active

When triggered, the safety lever causes both doors to slam shut and lock for 1 minute, during which time the bright-red furnace lever ips upward and can be triggered (see below). The doors can’t be opened from either side for the duration, and both levers ip to their original orientations when the doors unlock. The furnace lever won’t budge unless the safety mechanism is active.

**Furnace Lever (Red).** When pulled, the furnace lever causes the torches set into the walls to erupt with gouts of flame. Creatures inside the fire-filled crematorium must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 44 (8d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Zombie Worker.** After the characters enter the crematorium for the rst time, a human zombie wearing a name tag that reads “Maurice” appears in the window of the opposite door and triggers the safety mechanism, trapping any characters inside the crematorium for 1 minute.

Maurice then places its mouldering hand on the red lever, preparing to trigger the furnace. The characters can try to distract the zombie from its task with magic or theatrics and by making DC 14 Charisma (Performance) check. On a successful check, the zombie gurgles contently and loses interest in the lever. It shuffles along when the doors unlock. On a failed check, the zombie pulls the furnace lever.

### M6: Corpse Retrieval

*A metal chute is set into the wall of this foul chamber. Grisly puddles spatter the oor, and corpses topple from an overturned cart. The stench is gag worthy*

Corpse collectors deliver bodies to the Mortuary in exchange for paltry sums, dumping them into 10-foot-square chutes overseen by Herald of Dust guards. The bodies slide down the steep chutes to retrieval rooms, occasionally colliding with unsuspecting occupants. 

Shortly after the characters arrive, a corpse tumbles down the chute and lands with a splat, disgorging a hostile black pudding. As the ooze accosts the party, bodies continue to spill from the chute.

**Falling Corpses.** On initiative count 20, creatures within 10 feet of the chute must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and have the prone condition. The chute stops ejecting corpses after 3 rounds. 

**Escape.** After dealing with the ooze, the characters can climb up a corpse chute to the surface. Doing so requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. The chute opens into Ragpicker’s Square (see the “Surfacing in Sigil” section later in this chapter).

### M7: Dining Hall

*An ornate chandelier hangs over this lavish dining hall. Empty, high-backed chairs with decorative cushions sit before several covered platters. A ghostly butler rises from the floor before you, a decanter of ruby-red wine in its hand. The spirit speaks in a hollow voice, “Dinner is served.”*

Heralds of Dust enjoy their last meals in this lavish hall before undergoing necromantic rituals. The table is set for the number of characters in the party. 

Kingsley, a lawful evil ghost butler, has prepared a meal, tailoring dishes to each character’s tastes. If a character removes a platter’s lid, it reveals their favorite food, masterfully prepared. Let each player describe what meal awaits their character. 

The dinner is laced with poison. A creature that partakes in any food or drink in this room must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

**Treasure.** The silverware on the table is collectively worth 200 gp.

### M8: Burial Grove

*Snow blankets this quiet, indoor grove of icy brambles. Carcasses worn by time lie partially buried in the sleet and ice. A skeletal, black-barked tree looms over the gloomy orchard. Its branches bear a single fruit.*

Bodies undergo a slow, natural decay in this funereal thicket. Three spindly dryads oversee the decomposition, ensuring no one disturbs the process. The dryads allow the characters into the grove, mentioning that though the characters walk as the living do, they stink of death. 

A Gulthias tree (see the “Blights” entry in the Monster Manual), surrounded by brambles, rises above the thicket. It bears a single, bone-white fruit resembling an apple. A creature that eats half or more of the fruit takes 70 necrotic damage. The dryads don’t stop characters from picking the fruit.

### M9: Records Room

*A oating feline skull with gemstone eyes hovers above an aged desk strewn with elegant stationery. Deep in thought, the skull chews a black fountain pen in its ink- stained, bony fangs. A sea of crumpled papers is strewn throughout the chamber, and dusty scrolls line pigeonholes along the walls.*

The records room is the lair of Thaeziagnuz, a demilich poet tasked with eulogizing Sigil’s dead. Thaeziagnuz can speak, read, and write Common. Once a tabaxi bard of great renown, Thaeziagnuz has a case of writer’s block. Piles of crinkled obituaries surround the skull’s desk. 

The cranky demilich is initially indifferent toward the characters. When the characters enter, the Undead poet laments its situation and asks them to help it complete a brief epitaph for a member of the Doomguard who drowned in a bathhouse yesterday. A character can try to improve Thaeziagnuz’s epitaph by making a DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion or Performance) check. On a successful check, the demilich becomes friendly toward the characters; on a failed check, it howls in frustration. If the character fails this check a second time, the demilich attacks until the characters retreat from the room.

**Pigeonholes.** Death certicates ll a network of cubbyholes around Thaeziagnuz’s desk. A character can locate their own death certicate by searching for it and succeeding on a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Curiously, one eld remains blank on each of the characters’ death certicates: their cause of death.

### M10: Hallway

The stairway in this musty hallway ascends to a cellar door at the edge of the Mortuary’s grounds near the Hive Ward (see the following section). An iron gate at the south end of the corridor leads to other areas in the Mortuary, but they are beyond the scope of this adventure.

### Surfacing Sigil

When the characters exit the Mortuary, read or paraphrase the following description

*You emerge from the Mortuary into a dilapidated city square. Stacks of jumbled tenements—grimy hodgepodges of lopsided architecture joined by rickety bridges— loom over the persistent, low-hanging fog. An impossible city unfolds around you. Bladed buildings rise on all sides, the urban sprawl spreading along the inside of a gigantic torus. The metropolitan ring curves upward into passing clouds, disappearing behind the haze*
