We left the group encountering the Dancing Man atop a bridge that spans from the Lower Ward to the Hive. The characters stormed him with questions regarding his life and his wellness, only to learn that he acknowledges his past life, he is happy with the second chance he's given. He passed through the Eternal Boundary. Now in the garments of the Society of Sensation. The deity that had been shown to him is Sune.

Next up, they visited the Fiend's Saluter Inn, where they met Darius (the final member of the company). He suffers from the same fate as them and has contacts with Orianna. Darius kept a friendly demeanor with Clarion, and vice versa. 

Derioch showed up afterwards to inform them about Eliath and his appearance in the Lower Ward. Derioch insists something is wrong with the Mortuary and that the Dustmen are in deep. Also, she informed them that Shadowknave is a mercenary who keeps his hands bloody, and not with his own blood. 

The company headed towards the inn at the Lower Ward to find Eliath dressed in the colours of the Doomguards, alognside his patrol unit. They snatched him to the side secretly, only to get the same result as the Dancing Man: he is content with his second chance and there's no way they will ruin it for him. The deity that appeared to him through the passage of the Eternal Boundary is Jergal. 

Later on, they decided to revisit the Mortuary, only this time demanding more pressing information. After some shenanigans, they managed to get to Toranna's room and Rubicon turned invisible, sneaking in her room, finding a symbol of Cyric and the beads to the Elemental Plane of Fire. He took them with him, except the symbol.

After not being able to find anything useful out of Toranna, Darius decided to charm her, thus learning the entire truth about the Reverie. About its leader, their goal, their motives. As well as the nature of the Citadel of fire, being the headquarters of the Reverie and it's occupants. The key to the portal is the red beads she keeps in her drawer. Toranna, while charmed, agreed to provide them passage to the Citadel, however when returning to retrieve the beads, she found that the drawer was empty. Somebody has stolen the beads.

At that time, Rubicon decided to assassinate Toranna, dealing a great deal of damage to her, however he did not  expect her to live. She managed to give her all, fighting until completely dead. She didn't raise any alarm, the PCs knew the truth about her being the double agent in the hood of the Mortuary, and if Skall learned about her intrusion, death would be the mercy he would show to her. 

She felt to the floor, while Darius smartly took her form with a Disguise Self spell. They wrapped her in mummification cloths and Darius ordered some Dustmen to incinerate her into one of the portals. He passed the Diplomacy check and the guards didn't respond, they followed orders of Toranna.

Darius stays in the Mortuary disguised as Toranna. In the meantime, the PCs return to their rooms to lick their wounds and think this through.
