*Location: Anywhere is Sigil, except Hive Ward*

Sigil’s tripartite of justice—the Fraternity of Order, the Harmonium, and the Mercykillers—has learned of the character’s multiversal glitch, whether from the Heralds of Dust or a creature that witnessed the characters’ spontaneous resurrection. The Guvners deploy a cadre of Harmonium officers to place the characters under arrest.

When the time is right (probably after ending the whole Eternal Boundary sub-plot and the Guvners realise the deaths in the Hive have no connection with that of the characters), play the following act:

*A hush washes over the area, eclipsed by the march of heavy boots. Three officers of the Harmonium—burly guards in spotless, red plate armour—brandish menacing, clawed polearms in your direction. “Halt, criminal!” demands one of the peacekeepers, a squinting human with a gold front tooth. “You’re under arrest for violating the laws of the multiverse. We can do this the easy way.” The menacing jaws on the Harmonium officers’ polearms snap open with a clink. “Or the hard way.”*

The three Harmonium peacekeepers (see Morte’s Planar Parade) command the characters to drop their weapons and come quietly. The officers have been ordered to bring the characters before the High Courts of Sigil, where the characters must stand trial for supposed crimes against reality.

The Harmonium officers attempt to detain the characters with their pincered polearms and walk them to the city courts. Failing that, they try to knock the characters unconscious and place them in shackles.

## Development

Whether they evade the Harmonium pursuers or get caught, the characters' paths are about to cross with [[Valkor "Josbert"]] , a figure they may—or may not—recognize. His intervention feels timely… too timely. Almost like it was waiting to happen.

**Escape.** If the characters defeat or elude the Harmonium squad, they don’t get far before running into a lone Harmonium officer posted just off the main route—oddly unalarmed, unusually calm. With practiced ease, he ushers them into a shuttered alleyway and into a rundown storage room. It’s only once inside, out of sight, that he reveals the truth: the uniform is a disguise, the name is borrowed, and he knows far more than he should.

>*“This way. Quickly.”*

*(he glances around, keeping his voice low and brisk)*

> *“Don’t ask why I’m helping. I don’t know. I just... couldn’t let them take you.”*

> *“Something about you—it’s familiar. Can’t place it, but it’s there. Maybe we’ve met. Maybe we haven’t. Doesn’t matter right now.”*

*(he taps a rusted sigil-marked gate with two fingers, checking its stability)*

>*“I know a path through Undersigil. It'll get us to the Lower Ward without another Harmonium patrol breathing down our necks. Not exactly comfortable, but safer than the Courts.”*

>*“You want to stay free? Follow me. You want answers? One step at a time.”*

**Capture.** If the characters are manacled and being marched to the city courts, the procession is interrupted en route. A higher-ranking officer—at least, judging by the insignia—intercepts the squad with papers, orders, and a cutting tone. 

> "*Squad Delta-Two! Stand down–this transfer's out of your jurisdiction.*"

The real Harmonium officers falter. There’s confusion. Bureaucratic protocol wins over immediate suspicion. 

> "What the hell are you talking about? We weren't–"
> "High Court override. Move."
> "It's got the Guvner seal. Didn't you read it?"

The Harmonium falter. One hesitates—then shrugs. _“Whatever. They're not our problem anymore.”_ The squad tosses the manacles to the ground and turns to leave. When the shackles fall open and chaos briefly ensues, this “officer” pulls the party aside into the shadows.

>*"Bureaucracy never changes, does it? All that order and no memory."*

With a flash of false credentials and quicksilver instincts, the party finds themselves not prisoners, but fugitives with a guide. Their pursuers scatter behind them, and ahead lies **Undersigil**—a maze of forgotten corridors, derelict paths, and long-abandoned truths.
