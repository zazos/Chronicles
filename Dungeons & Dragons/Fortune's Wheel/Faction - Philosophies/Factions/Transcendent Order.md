*Who Act Unfettered by Thought*

![[FactionTranscendentOrder5e.webp | 300]]

**Factol**: Rhys

**Headquarters**: Great Gymnasium

**Aligned Plane**: Elysium

**Members**: Athletes, daredevils, rescuers

**Epithet**: Ciphers

The Transcendent Order holds that for a person to attain a higher state of being, they must unify their mind and body until thought and action are one.

Those who act on instinct alone can achieve perfect harmony with the multiverse. Members of the Transcendent Order rigorously train every aspect of self to align with the cadence of the multiverse. Ciphers are encouraged toward athletic regiments, but many also pursue artistic endeavors to perfection, becoming dancers, virtuosos, or abstract painters. Whatever resonates with a Cipher’s path, they must practice until the body no longer requires the mind to guide it.

Factol Rhys (neutral, tiefling Transcendent Order conduit) stepped up to take control of the Transcendent Order when the last factol achieved perfect understanding and vanished right in front of Rhys and other ranking Ciphers. Rhys is an enlightening coach, providing direction to trainees with choice remarks.

**Faction Attire**. Athletes and acrobats of all shapes and sizes, Ciphers dress in simple clothing that allows for agility and flexibility.

**Role in Sigil**. The Transcendent Order headquarters in the Great Gymnasium in the Market Ward. There, the Ciphers train their bodies to attune to their minds and the multiverse’s ebb and flow. The Transcendent Order looks inward for meaning, and thus it tends not to form alliances with other factions. Its members are generally well liked, and no ascendant faction opposes the Ciphers outright.

## Do Not Think About Doing It ... Do It!

For many clueless primes, the philosophy of the Transcendent Order is one of the hardest to grasp. So much so, in fact, that the faction’s been dubbed the _“Ciphers”_—as if they talk in some secret code. In fact, it’s quite a simple concept that they espouse: Trust your Instincts, Do what your Body Tells You, and Act in Cordance with the Multiverse.

Besides being the best martial artists in the Cage (comes from all that meditation, presumably), the Ciphers have the best gymnasia, saunas, massage parlours and hot pools. If a cutter’s looking to relax, he’d better jump in a bath with a Cipher. The faction’s also renowned for its diplomacy; which is perhaps a surprise, because when most bashers say whatever comes into their head first (like the Ciphers tend to do), it’s usually the start of problems. Maybe that speaks a volume or two for the level to which the Transcendent Order really _live_ their philosophies.

While they don’t usually talk much, I’ve persuaded a few Ciphers to part with some of the chant of their faction… don’t just _think_ about reading it! Read it!
