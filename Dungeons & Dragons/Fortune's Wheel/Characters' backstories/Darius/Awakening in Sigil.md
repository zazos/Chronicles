You bolt upright in tattered bed, your head pounding like a thousand war drums. The first think you notice is that your tongue feels like sandpaper, your stomach is twisted in knots and your limbs feel like they're been dragged through hell and back. 
As you get up from bed your vision swims in and out of focus. You glance about the room: a cheap flat. Feels like a cheap tavern in some suburban area. The kind of inn where the drinks are strong and regrets are stronger.

Looking out the window, you see the impossible however. An unimaginably huge torus engulfs the sky, building built atop each other fade in and out of the industrial smoke of the area you live in. The smell of spice and meat combined with sweat and distant burnt ozone fills your lungs. The ever-busy streets and corridors of this twisted city seem to defy gravity and reason, a cacophony of planar beings moving through this impossible city.

In your confusion, it hits you like a serpent's sting:
You dont remember getting here.
Hell, you dont remember the last thing you did before this.

(You remember most of your backstory until a certain point, until memory fragments scatter and nothing feels real and consistent)

The worst part of it: you feel you've been here before.

Your muscles tense, as if some part of you expects something to happen. Something inevitable, pre-written.

The shadows shift, the air thickens becoming almost syrupy, heavy with the scent of sulfur and jasmine. This sickly sweet perfume is known to you, followed by the smooth as honeyed poison voice:

*Do not try to look so bewildered, Darius. It makes you seem... mortal.*

You turn.

Sitting at the room's lone chair, her golden serpentine tail slowly wraps around the chair's legs, her six hands idly adjusting the rings on her fingers, flicking dust from her shimmering robes that reflect the candlelight like liquid gold. 
Her regal hooded cobra-like feature remain expressionless, but her eyes burn like molten gold.

![[Irmara, The Gilded Serpent.webp]]

She examines you, like one would a pet who's just learned a new trick.

*And here i thought you were finally growing out of these little episodes of yours
Yet again, i find you tangled in your own confusion, wandering without a purpose.*

She leans forward, the weight of her presence pressing into the room, suffocating. Intoxicating. 

*Tell me Darius, do you think this is the first time you've woken up like this?*

There's an undertone to her words. Not quite amusement, not quite irritation. But something coiling, something deeper. 

You ask her about your amnesiac state, your lack of memory and the meaning of this place. Where the hell are you!

Irmara scoffs, shaking her head like a mother unimpressed by a child's excuses.

*Sigil is filth. A grand, cosmic circus where the planes empty their refuse. And yet, here you are, in the thick of it.*

She tilts her head slighlty, molten gold eyes unblinking.

*Tell me, Darius, in all your little studies on demons and their ways, have you ever stopped to ask yourself how much of the soul trade the succubi control?*

Her six hands move absently as she speaks, conjuring infernal sigils into the air.

*A tenth.
One out of every ten souls damned to the Abyss finds its way there not by blade, not by conquest, not even by raw greed. But by a whispered promise, a lingering kiss, a slow burning seduction.*

She leans forward, her tail tightening around the chair with a slow, deliberate creak.

*The Original Sin Cartel, Darius. A collection of ten of the most ambitious, most dangerous succubi in the multiverse. Their tongues sharpened to cut cleaner than any devil’s blade. Their empire built not on war, but on patience. A plague to our Blood War*

She scoffs.

*They don't squabble like tanar'ri. They do not kneel like mortals. And that's what makes them so... insufferably effective.*

She lifts a single ringed hand and with a flick of her clawed fingers, the air wraps and nine names drift into your mind, one after another, like poison droplets in a goblet.

- Chiryn, Mistress of Pleasure and Pain.
- Red Shroud, Poisoner and Ruler of Broken Reach.
- Maretta, Lady of the Counting House.
- Meerena, of the Fated.
- Latana, of the Seductive Magics.
- Saskia, of the Doomguard.
- Tonja, of the Troubled Mind.
- Stiletto, the Enforcer.
- Safira, the Twisted.
- And one more…

She pauses.

Irmara tilts her head, her forked tongue flicking between white teeth, a serpentine and infernal amusement flickering across her face.

*Ah but Nari. Sweet, foolish Nari.*

She savors the name, as though enjoying a good show of suffering.

*She is the newest, the most… vulnerable. The Cartel has already chosen her for sacrifice, though she has yet to realize it. A lamb painted as a wolf, walking to slaughter thinking it is conquest.*

She rises, her movement impossibly smooth for her size, like a silk ribbon sliding off a blade.

*The Cartel is an infection, one that He seeks to burn away, that others seek to claim for themselves. But you, oh my little serpent...*

She draws you near, her tail coiling around you, lifting you closer to her. He cold breath tinged with the scent of spice, metal and something deeply wrong. 

*You are the scalpel that determines where the blade will fall.*

*Orianna is the key. The girl walks with destiny at her back, unaware that her every step treads the paths paved for her. She must find the cracks within the Cartel. And you?*

The temperature drops, the air turns thin and you can feel it. The familiar cold grip of her punishment. 

*You will make certain those cracks become fractures. That her work does not serve the wrong hands.*

For a brief moment, your lungs crystallize from the infernal cold.
On your last heartbeat, her forked tongue flicks a single drop of venom from her lips to yours.
Like honeyed poison, it slides down your throat and finds its way to your lungs.
The sensation burns.
Not fire. Note ice. Something worse.

A beat later, you gasp for air.

*I do not care how you do it. I do not care what methods you employ. You may lie, steal, carve truth from the marrow of the fools who oppose you. But you will not fail me.*

She gently puts you down and uncoils her tail from your waist. 

*Good boy.*

The room returns to normal and the scent of jasmine and sulfur fades. 

She is gone. For now. 

You stand alone in the dim light, heart pounding.

The names echo in your mind.
One out of ten.
Original Sin Cartel.
Orianna.
Nari.

This doesn't feel like your regular hangover Darius. Your presence in the story is no coincidence. 

And the worst part of all is that somewhere, deep in the pit of your gut, in the very primal essence of your being, in the lingering droplet of venom she left behind...

You already knew that.
