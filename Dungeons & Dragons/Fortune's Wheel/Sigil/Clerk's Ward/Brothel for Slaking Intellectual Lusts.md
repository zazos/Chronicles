# Brothel for Slaking Intellectual Lusts

>*The brothel is intended to slate the lusts of even the hardened intellectual. It is designed to stimulate the mind, to heighten one's awareness of themselves and others, to create new ways of experiencing another person. It is for those who seek something more than the shallow physical pleasures that fill the Hive and Lower Wards.*
>– Fall-from-Grace

The **Brothel for Slaking Intellectual Lusts** was an establishment in the **Clerk's Ward** of Sigil. Even though the building was a brothel, the "prostitutes" within it were actually aspiring [[Society of Sensation|Sensates]]. They did not serve their patrons physically; instead, they learned to identify with others so that they could better understand themselves and the Planes, and offered this experience to their clients in turn.

Within the brothel, patrons who have paid an entry fee were allowed to speak with any of the courtesans within based on the topic of conversation that they were trained in. Topics ranged from friendliness and food, relationship advice, philosophy and ethics, and discussing the Powers themselves.

### Inhabitants (WIP for when needed)

- **Dolora (very human-like automaton/android)** (Sense Motive DC 25, Insight DC 18 to realize she's not human): Highly skilled at debate and games of skill, less so word games or games of luck. Her room is highly ordered, with two comfortable armchairs facing each other in front of a gentle fire. Despite being an automaton, she speaks well and realistically, rarely slipping into more automated responses. She can be very convincing. Boon: Diplomacy +4 OR Advantage on Persuasion checks.
    
- **Ecco (Human)**: An excellent listener, despite being mute. She makes you feel like she really cares. She can pull out all of your innermost secrets and doesn't show a hint of judgement. In fact, she seems sympathetic to every woe and worry. Her room is welcoming, with a reclining couch for you and a chair right next to it for her. Boon: +4 to Concentration OR Advantage on Constitution saves to maintain concentration (after talking with her, your mind is more focused and less distracted).
    
- **Vivian (Aasimar)**: Somewhat self centered, she highly appreciates the arts, especially beauty. Conversations with her end up being highly relaxing, casual talk about beauty tips, including magical beauty secrets, or the arts of all varieties, everything from visual to auditory to olfactory decadence. She uses the finest magical perfumes on herself and her room, which also has a detailed stain glass window covering one entire wall of her room.  
    Boon: Performance (all) and Animal Handling +4 OR Advantage on Performance and Animal Handling checks. (Unless Performance checks are common in your campaign, in which case just those. They've always been really rare in mine, even with bards.)
    
- **Yves (Dryad)**: She has a very distinct room. The door looks like it was grown in place, and at the center of her room is a natural looking pool, which she reclines in almost all the time. She is bound to the pool, so she doesn't get around. Instead, she loves listening to and retelling stories from all her visitors. Guests can request a tale about something specific, or just listen for hours, or tell their own adventures.  
    Boon: Knowledge (all) +4 OR Advantage on History and Religion checks (Again, just History if those checks are very common in your campaign, or add Nature if both History and Religion are extremely rare).
    
- **Juliette (Elf, cursed to live forever)**: A...special one. Unlike Yves, she definitely does get around, and has had numerous explosive relationships. Nevertheless, she gives excellent relationship advice. She just doesn't follow it. Advertised at specializing in giving "perspective," she always has a worse story to tell than yours, making your own life seem simple in comparison. Are you being hounded by a Lich? Well, she once dated a Vampire minion of Vecna. A dozen curses and one century under the heel of an Ifrit slave-driver later, boy did that end up badly. You get the idea. It's kind of mesmerizing listening to her, but she does listen to you as well, and offers a sympathetic ear with real, useful advice. Boon: Bluff +4 OR Advantage on Deception checks. (Her stories are always kind of outrageous, and offer some good inspiration for convincing stories of your own)

- **Kesai-Serris (Lammasu)**: Relatively deep, and well educated, she specializes in a wide variety of philosophical topics, including ethics and the nature of reality. She keeps an open-air balcony as her "room," with lounge couches and a Greco-Roman aesthetic in homage to the founders of philosophy (This can be different if your world has a specific ancient culture, like a great philosophical Yuan-Ti empire). Conversations with are less of a debate than Dolora and more an exchange of ideas, though she does know a fair amount about how the Planes work and are arranged. Boon: One additional use of a class skill per day/long rest (Rage, Animal shape, Turn Undead/Channel Divinity, etc.)
    
- **Kimasxi "Adder-Tongue" (Tiefling)**: The BDSM of dialogue. She specializes in banter, bordering on insults and abuse, though she can sometimes tone it down if she tries. Conversations with her sometimes sound like something from Taming of the Shrew or another Shakespearean comedy. She isn't above insulting names, but often strives for more clever insults. Boon: Intimidation +4 OR Advantage on Intimidation checks.
    
- **Marissa (Medusa)**: She understands the power of words and hidden secrets, which she collects. The first thing anyone entering her room will notice is that it is pitch black. She is highly aware of the power of her gaze, and sits behind multiple defenses on behalf of her guests: the darkness, a veil, and often a screen as well. Her room, if you can see in it, is lined with scrolls, some of which are very ancient. She is an excellent source of secret information, from rituals to spells to the names of long forgotten kings, which she tends to gives relatively freely, or in exchange for new information. She can also easily be a quest-giver to retrieve some ancient tome or scroll. Boon: Spellcraft +4 OR Advantage on Arcana checks. Also, the scrolls are full of spells, which a wizard can copy into their spellbook. The room has an enchantment that halves the time to copy spells. A client can pay more to take the time to copy more spells and continue the session, as well, but depending on the DM, the cost might or might not be higher for not having an appointment. It is also up to the DM what level spells are available, but in general high level spells should be present, and most if not all low level spells. For higher level spells, since she is a Medusa, she typically has spells charm and trapping/stunning spells which would help her force a foe to look her in the eyes.
    
- **Nenny Nine-Eyes (Yuan-Ti)**: Has an ear to the ground. Informants come to her both to learn and share gossip and personal secrets, even governmental espionage, too. She can give the locations of individuals who might otherwise be well hidden, or offer the true name of a Doppleganger masquerading through the city. No one really knows how she gets all of her information. She is sometimes cautious, though, and offers only hints if she thinks the information is too personal or dangerous, but generally her morality doesn't keep her mouth shut often. Her room is well protected, both from magical and nonmagical eavesdroppers, as well as from attack, since there are some who would rightly assume she knows too much and needs to be silenced, but with the help of Fall-From-Grace and the other courtesans, she keeps her little alcove peaceful. Boon: Gather Information and Search +2 OR Advantage on Investigation checks. And, of course, some valuable piece of information on someone.
    
- **Irsu (Androsphinx)**: As like most sphinxes, he has a talent for riddles and clever speech. Unlike most sphinxes, he will sometimes offer further hints if the client is having trouble, and is generally very friendly. Like Kimasxi, a conversation with Irsu is often like a difficult duel, but a much more friendly exchange of allusions and riddles. He will often greet a guest by saying "Please, It has four legs but cannot run, and a back but cannot speak. It is for you." The correct response would be to sit down in the plush chair across from him. His room is the largest of the courtesans, to fit his large size, but he reclines in a slight recess, bringing his face roughly level with a standing human's. Boon: Will saves +2 vs. Illusion and Charm OR Advantage on Intelligence saves and Wisdom saves against charm.
