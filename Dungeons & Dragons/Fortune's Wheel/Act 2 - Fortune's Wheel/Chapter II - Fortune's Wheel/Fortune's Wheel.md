## F1: Dragon Bar 
<img src="Fortunes Wheel Dragon Bar spectacle.png" class="rightimg" height=500>

[[Fortunes Wheel Dragon Bar.png|Show To Players]]
The Dragon Bar is an extravagant reception area where gamblers gather before hitting the casino proper. 

When the characters enter, the ghost of a washed-up stage magician known as the Great Stephen Amber is performing sleight-of-hand tricks for an audience of a few dozen low-stakes noble gamblers and three gnoll hecklers. 
At the southeast corner of the bar is a simple door minded by an oni bouncer named Vez. The oni ensures that only those who meet Shemeshka’s thresholds for wealth and interest are admitted to area F3. He has orders to welcome the characters.

### F1a: Bar

A sculpture of a red dragon head protrudes from the wall above this mirrored bar, which is tended by a dead-eyed, lawful neutral equinal guardinal named [[Brayson.png|Brayson]]. He is taciturn but friendly.

### F1b: Hotel Access

A staircase near the main entrance ascends to a carpeted hallway of numbered, five-star suites. These accommodations exist in demiplanes accessible by guests and casino staff, or anyone else in possession of a room’s portal key. 

### F1c: Kitchen

Five steam mephit chefs prepare meals for guests in this hectic kitchen. 

### F1d: Stage

Opening acts take place on a small, curtained stage. Between shows, performers can be found in a dressing room adjacent to the stage. 

### F1e: Wheel

This room, reminiscent of a museum exhibit, houses the original fortune’s wheel: an eye-catching, vertical iron cartwheel. Gilded pay-outs decorate its weathered surface, including one coveted gold square that once paid out ludicrous sums. This roulette has since been decommissioned, replaced by the one in area F7.


## F2: Casino Cages

Here gamblers can cash out their winnings or purchase razorleaves for 10 gp a piece. An attentive imp cashier sits behind each barred window, retrieving chips and funds from secure portals only they can access. There are two cages in Fortune’s Wheel: one in the Dragon Bar with two cashiers and a slightly larger office in the casino proper with three. 

**Welcome Gifts.** When the characters first visit one of the casino cages, a teller gives them each a black satin bag containing 10 razorleaves. If the characters aren’t already aware of the casino beyond the Dragon Bar, an imp encourages them to speak with [[Vez.webp|Vez the oni]].

## F3: Illusory Fountain
<img src="Fortunes Wheel Dragon Bar.png" class="rightimg" height=300>

[[Fortunes Wheel Dragon Bar.png|Show To Players]]

*Heavy doors swing inward, revealing a jingling fountain of gold coins rising from the floor of an extravagant gambling hall. The glittering spout originates from the open palm of a statue depicting a confident arcanaloth cast in solid gold. The fountain’s inscription reads, “Fortune Favors the Bold.”* 

Hundreds of people from across the planes congregate around all manner of games, refreshments, and performances in this lavish, magical casino. 

This golden statue depicts the casino’s owner, Shemeshka. The coins are an illusion. Physical inspection of the fountain, a detect magic spell, or a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals them as such. 

**Scrying Statue**. Creatures in the security room (area F10) can see and hear through the statue as if they were standing in its place. A detect magic spell reveals an aura of divination magic around the statue. 

**Treasure**. The statue is worth 5,000 gp, but damaging any part of it draws the immediate ire of two mezzoloth bouncers in the crowd nearby. 


## F4: Slot Machines
<img src="modron_slot_machine.png" class="rightimg" height=400>
The first time a character approaches a slot machine, read or paraphrase the following text:

[[modron_slot_machine.png|Show To Players]]

*A wiry-haired night hag jumps for joy before a boxy clockwork machine fitted with a hand lever. The machine’s three, faintly glowing reels display the images of two gray worms and a golden ring. “Come to mama,” giggles the hag as three writhing grubs wiggle from the dispensary slot and into a brass bucket at her feet*


[[nighthag_slot_machine.webp|Putrice]], a friendly night hag, just hit it big on the slots, a maze of gambling machines. Most of the slot machines are clockwork cabinets of gnomish construction, but four are stationary, indifferent duodrones that work for the casino. As she pockets the worms for use in dark rituals, Putrice is happy to explain how the luck-based machines work. 

A game of slots costs 1 razorleaf to play. When a participant inserts a chip into the machine, roll three d6s. Each number on the die corresponds to a symbol displayed on the slot machine’s reels and its prizes, as shown on the Slot Machine Results table. Prizes are dispensed from a slot at the base of the machines.

**There are four possible outcomes when playing slots:** 

**One of a Kind**. If the reels display three different symbols, the participant doesn’t win a prize. The slot machine produces a sad trumpet noise. 

**Two of a Kind**. If the reels display two identical symbols, the participant wins the two-of-a-kind prize listed on the Slot Machine Results table for that symbol. 

**Jackpot**. If all three symbols match, the participant wins the jackpot prize listed on the Slot Machine Results table for that symbol. Each jackpot can be won only once. Subsequent jackpots for a given symbol result in a two-of-a-kind prize. 

**Modron Time!** If the reels display a tooth (2), a gear (4), and a pitchfork (6) in any order, the four duodrone slot machines do a coordinated jig, and the participant gains the ability to reroll one or more of the d6s on their next pull of a slot machine lever, as fortune tilts in their favor.**

**Slot Machine Results** 

| d6  | Symbol    | Prize (Two of a Kind)                                                    | Jackpot                     |

## F5: Table Games
<img src="duodrones_croupiers.webp" class="rightimg" height=500>

[[duodrones_croupiers.webp|Show To Players]]

Various games take place at velvet-lined tables in this open area. Three games are detailed below; at your discretion, Fortune’s Wheel might contain other table games of your own creation. The buy-in for a table game is 1 razorleaf per game unless anyone is feeling lucky and wants to up the ante. 

The dealers at each table game are indifferent toward the characters. Dealers abstain from combat but defend themselves if threatened. A mezzoloth pit boss watches over each group of tables, keeping an eye out for cheaters and troublemakers.

**Dead Hand’s Dice**. A vampire croupier coalesces from a cloud of mist to conduct dead hand’s dice, a dice game popular among spacefaring pirates in the Astral Sea. The rules are as follows: 

Each participant’s player chooses any number of d6s (known as “bones”) and shakes them in a cup. 

You choose any number of d6s as well, and roll for the dealer and participating NPCs. 

Everyone rolls and reveals their dice at once. 

The participant with the highest total wins, but anyone who rolls a 1 automatically loses. 


**Olidammara’s Bounty.** Named after a god of revelry, this game is played on a long table embroidered with a flat pattern of an unfolded, twenty-sided die. The game’s dealer is also its deciding piece: a spectator shaped like an icosahedron that rolls itself on the table once all bets have been placed to determine the outcome. The rules are as follows: 

**Participant Bets.** Participants bet on one or more numbers between 1 and 20. To place a bet, a participant places at least 1 razorleaf on that number’s triangular space on the game table. There’s no limit to how many numbers a participant bets on, but they must wager at least one chip for each number. 

**Dealer’s Roll.** After all bets are placed, the dealer rolls itself. Roll a d20; if the number on the die matches a number on which the participant bet, the participant collects five times the amount of chips they wagered. Chips wagered on any other numbers are lost.

## F6: Big Ticket Prize

This area displays a gilded apparatus of Kwalish, a prize that can be won by spinning the fortune’s wheel in area F7. If the characters take the apparatus for a joyride, two mezzoloth bouncers arrive in 3 rounds and demand the characters vacate the apparatus or be escorted to their room by force. 


## F7: Fortune's Wheel
<img src="spin_the_wheel.png" class="rightimg" height=1000>

[[spin_the_wheel.png|Show To Players]]

*This hall holds the game after which the casino is named: fortune’s wheel. The dazzling, upright roulette wheel, decorated with blinking lights and prizes galore, rises from an ornate stage of its own. A plush throne sits before the wheel before a marble platform fitted with a coin slot and a large level.* 

Fortune’s wheel is the casino’s signature experience: an exciting game of chance where fortunes are won or lost. The fortune’s wheel consists of three concentric spinning wheels and measures 10 feet in diameter. It occupies its own roped-off stage. 

**Spinning the Wheel**. Fortune’s wheel costs 5 razorleaves per spin, and a creature is allowed only one spin every 24 hours (the wheel doesn’t function if more spins are attempted). To play, the participant sits in the chair, inserts the chips into a slot in the pedestal, and pulls the lever. To determine the result, roll a d10 and consult the Outer Wheel column of the Fortune’s Wheel Results table, following its instructions or comparing the result to the entries below. The game always starts on the outer wheel and ends with a single result. 


<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

**Bag**. The participant wins a bag of holding. 
**Big-Ticket Prize**. The participant wins the gilded apparatus of Kwalish in area F6. The apparatus remains in Fortune’s Wheel for the evening. At your discretion, Valek can arrange for the apparatus to be delivered to the characters in the Outlands during part 2 of the adventure. 
**Coin**. The participant wins 50 gp. 
**Coins, Two**. The participant wins 500 gp. 
**Coins, Three.** The participant wins 5,000 gp. 
**Compass**. The participant wins a portal compass (see Sigil and the Outlands). 
**Crown**. The participant becomes a quasi-deity with a petty portfolio, such as dust mites, scheduling conflicts, gazebos, or three-toed sloths. Celestials and 
Fiends acknowledge the participant’s godly status, but with no followers to boast, the participant is divine in name only. At your discretion, the winner might gain additional minor abilities related to their portfolio, such as controlling dust mites or understanding sloths. The Lady of Pain and other figures who seek to oust gods from Sigil pay the winner no attention.
**Feather**. The participant wins a Quaal’s feather token (bird). 
**Flask**. The participant wins a flask of holy water. 
**Four-Leaf Clover**. The participant wins a stone of good luck. 
**Fox**. The participant wins a citrine figurine of wondrous power (onyx dog) that becomes a Medium fox (mastiff) when its command word is spoken. 
**Ghost**. The participant wins a bottle containing the soul of an unknown creature. Removing the stopper frees the soul inside, allowing it to proceed to the afterlife.
**House**. The participant wins a property deed to a modest home in a gate-town of your choosing. 
**Key**. The participant wins a random portal key. 
**Letter**. The participant wins a letter of recommendation (see the Dungeon Master’s Guide) penned by Shemeshka. 
**Star**. The participant gains a boon of luck (see the Dungeon Master’s Guide). 
**Stein**. The participant wins a drink at the Ice Lounge (area F8). 
**Sword**. The participant wins a +1 weapon of their choice. 
**Tentacle**. The participant wins the still-writhing tentacle of a mind flayer. It’s sticky. 
**Trinket**. The participant wins one random trinket (roll on the Trinkets table in the Player’s Handbook). 
**Tongue**. The participant gains the ability to speak one language of their choice. 
**Tunic**. The participant wins a tunic sized for them that reads “I spun Fortune’s Wheel, and all I got was this lousy tunic.” 

## F8: Ice Lounge

Chilly fog emanates from the Ice Lounge, a bar chipped from a magic glacier. Its bartender is Phiwi, a warm-hearted yeti who speaks Common. The mixologist’s specialty is a face-numbing cocktail called the Abominable Yes Please. 

**Sulking Dragon.** Winter’s Bite, a piteous young white dragon, sits at the bar with his head hung, fidgeting with a single gold piece as he drowns his sorrow. The coin is all that remains of the dragon’s hoard—he gambled the rest away in a single night. Worse yet, the foolhardy dragon has racked up a 100 gp bar tab he can no longer afford. If a character pays off the dragon’s debt, Winter’s Bite thanks the character, calling them a “friend of dragonkind“ before he departs the casino, never to return.

## F9: Stage
<img src="vecna_impersonator.png" class="rightimg" height=500>

[[vecna_impersonator.png|Show To Players]]

A lofty, curtained stage rises at one end of the hall. Each evening, it boasts an assortment of acts. Behind the stage, performers prepare for the next act. A high-strung satyr stage manager, Grigsby, roves between storage spaces and a dressing room strewn with makeup and bewitching costumes. 

Three acts take place on the stage: 

**Beyond Reality with Bimdom Baffletrick**. A charming illusionist in glittery, purple robes, Bimdom Baffletrick (chaotic neutral, gnome mage) performs arcane feats. His assistant is a friendly, white-furred weretiger named Felix. 

**Star Performer**. A silver-haired singer of great renown named Estrella (chaotic neutral, elf noble) brightens the stage each night in a shimmering sequined dress. 

**Tombstone Troubadour**. An icon from the faraway land of San Citlán, Cecilia Tlapaya (chaotic good ghost) takes the stage dressed in a sharp suit. The short-haired troubadour haunts a pearl-white guitar and is accompanied by a brassy band of ten lawful good skeletons.

## F10: Security Room

Three [[nothic.webp|nothics]] sit in this dim room, staring at screens connected to invisible sensors spread throughout the casino. The nothics can hear and see through the sensors as if they were there, but they can’t move them. In addition to their observation capabilities, the sensors extend the range of each nothic’s Weird Insight action, allowing the Aberrations to probe the minds of suspicious patrons. 
The sensors are located in the following areas: 
Inside the statue of Shemeshka (area F3) 
Directly above the participant’s seat at the fortune’s wheel (area F7) 
If the nothics observe any questionable activity, they raise an alarm heard only by the mezzoloths throughout the casino, directing them to the scene. 

## F11: Private Rooms

These lavish rooms are used for private meetings or exclusive table games. In one room, three hound archons (see Morte’s Planar Parade) are playing dead hand’s dice (see area F5). 

## F12: Portal to the Platinum Rooms

This unremarkable alcove stands in a back hall used by casino staff. Within is a portal that opens for creatures carrying an exceptionally rare platinum razorleaf chip. Those who brandish such a chip and step into the alcove emerge into the Platinum Rooms, which are detailed in chapter 14. 


# The Razorvine Chip

<img src="razorvine_platinum_chip.png" class="rightimg" height=300>
These are exceptionally rare casino tokens used in the Fortune's Wheel casino in Sigil.

Their primary function is as a key or pass to access the most exclusive areas of the casino, specifically the **Platinum Rooms**—the high-roller, secretive, and magical sections of Shemeshka's establishment

- Staff would immediately recognize the chip's significance. They would become highly attentive, deferential, and possibly nervous, as only the most important guests or those on special business for Shemeshka possess such a token.

[[Vez.webp]] or [[Valek.webp]] when shown the razorvine chip would flicker their eyes in recognition of the chip, but quickly mask any surprise with a practiced, neutral smile. They respond in a friendly, nonchalant tone:
> Ah, that’s quite a fancy piece you’ve got there! Some of our tokens are just for show, you know—souvenirs, collector’s items, that sort of thing. Folks like to believe they’re luckier than the rest. If you’re curious, you might want to ask at the main desk; they know all about the casino’s rarities. Enjoy your time at Fortune’s Wheel!

Individuals that own a razorvine chip are aware of it's importance. Additionally, Shemeshka has informed the staff about the patrons that will arrive for the Platinum Rooms.

- Most patrons would not recognize the chip, but high-rollers or those in the know might react with awe, envy, or suspicion.
*At a nearby gaming table, a well-dressed githzerai gambler notices your platinum chip as you pass. He leans over to his companion, whispering with a mix of awe and envy:*

> “Did you see that? They’ve got a platinum chip. That’s Shemeshka’s own mark—only the real high-ups get those. Wonder what they did to earn it… or who they had to cross.”

*The patron then gives you a lingering, speculative look*
