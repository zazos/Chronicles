The PCs must enter the casino, a decadent den of corruption, deals, and illusions. 
The Fortune’s Wheel is more than just a gambling hall—it is Shemeshka’s hunting ground, where she traps the desperate, the powerful, and the foolish alike.

- The PCs are expected.
- Shemeshka has orchestrated the meeting—the question is, _why?_
- The air is thick with tension and false pleasantries.

Shemeshka, in all her terrifying grace, welcomes them.

*"My dear, dear lost things. How many times have we done this now?”
“No? You don’t remember? Ah… how tragic. Let’s fix that, shall we?”*

She claims she knows them. That they have been here before. That they are loops in a broken story.

But just as Shemeshka begins to reveal what she knows, chaos erupts in the casino.

## Casino in Chaos & R04M's Escape

Whether orchestrated by Shemeshka herself or an unknown external force, something shatters the tense negotiations.

- A battle, a planar rift, a riot—something unnatural.
- Shemeshka vanishes into the chaos—was this planned, or was she caught off-guard?
- The PCs must fight, flee, or adapt in the midst of this breaking moment.

And in the confusion, R04M makes their move.

The modron, strangely independent and eerily self-aware, slips past the PCs, deliberately brushing against them as they pass.

In their hands, a small parchment—delivered so discreetly that it might have gone unnoticed.
