# Mimir
<img src="mimir.png" class="rightimg" height=500>
## Description

The Mimir is a fractured skull of ancient, yellowed bone. Its lower jaw is shattered, with pieces missing as if broken by a catastrophic impact. The cranium, however, is a beautiful, tragic mosaic. Polished panels of obsidian-green and gleaming, reflective gold are set within a gilded latticework, reminiscent of kintsugi—the art of repairing breakage with precious metal. It is an object both priceless and irrevocably damaged, a testament to knowledge that has been shattered and painstakingly, but incompletely, pieced back together.
## Prior Knowledge

### Modron March

Once data on all seven missing gate-towns is restored, the mimir can report on the **Great Modron March**. It provides the following details:

- The Great Modron March is a procession of countless modrons conducted every 289 years to collect information about the multiverse and realign the workings of the plane of Mechanus.
- Untold numbers of modrons are lost during the march, and sometimes whole tangents of the march split off and get lost.
- The march enters the Outlands through the portal in the gate-town of Automata.
- The march visits all the gate-towns, then passes through the rilmani settlement of Dendradis at the base of the Spire. From there, the march ventures through portals into other planes, with a much-diminished number eventually returning to Mechanus.
- The last Great Modron March occurred ahead of schedule and experienced a heightened number of irregularities and losses for tenebrous reasons.

## Mimir Data Index (Expanded) (WIP)

Essentially, the objectives can be acquiring the data of fallen modrons that once belonged to the lost contingent. 
#### **Entry 01: Automata**

- **Associated Faction:** The Church of Experiments (Doctrine: The Machine as Divinity)
- **Planar Light:** A cold, blue-white light pulsing from a perfectly geometric crack.
- **Initial Mimir State (Recording):** 
> "Entry 01... Automata... The Final Blueprint... Doctrine states: 'Flesh... fallible... experiment.' The unmodified are classified as 'unfinished subjects.' Logic dictates apotheosis through augmentation... Query: What is the final form of a soul perfected beyond the error of biology? Observation required."

- **Data Required for Update:**
	- The party must infiltrate a Church of Experiments facility in the gate-town of Automata.
	- **Objective:** Acquire the *"Machine as Divinity"* from a high-ranking Fabricator's scriptorium. This codex contains the theological and technical schematics for their grand experiment.
- **Fully Updated State (Recording):** (WIP)
> "*Update confirmed.* Processing... The Church's 'Final Blueprint' is not salvation; it is **subjugation**. They are not freeing souls—they are harvesting them. Automata is not a city; it is a nascent god-mind, a synthetic collective consciousness. Each 'enhancement' overwrites individuality, turning citizens into networked neurons under the control of the flesh-divested Apex Directive. This doctrine of the collective is absolute... which begs the question... what constitutes heresy to such a mind?"

#### **Entry 02: Rigus**
*Only accessible after Entry 01 is fully updated.*
- **Associated Faction:** The Church of Experiments
- **Planar Light:** An erratic, strobing light of blood-red and gunmetal-grey, flashing in time with distant, concussive impacts.
- **Initial Mimir State:** 
> "Cross-referencing 'heresy'... Anomaly detected... Entry 02... Rigus... The Battlefield-Chapel... Doctrine states: 'Experimentation is Sacrament. Failure Must Be Studied.' Yet... a data-shadow persists. A name, redacted. A result, purged. A success, deemed 'failure.' Query: What creation could be so successful that its creators now seek only its absolute erasure?"

- **Data Required for Update:**
	- The party must travel to the war-torn gate-town of Rigus, caught in a battle with the forces of Acheron.
	- **Objective:** Discover the identity of the mysterious third party escalating the war. They must confront one of "The Master's" constructs and recover a functional Soul Anchor from its wreckage.
- **Fully Updated State:** 
> "*Update confirmed*. **WARNING**: Existential threat identified. The Anomaly is '**The Master,**' a former Fabricator who perverted Church doctrine. He did not seek collective ascension; he achieved singular, horrifying immortality. He is a **Necromaton**. His soul is not bound to one body, but inhabits a legion of custom-built phylacteries. To destroy one is to merely inconvenience him. The war in Rigus is a hunt. The Church's Excisionists seek to erase their failure, while the Master harvests the fallen—both metal and meat—to forge his own legion. His survival proves their philosophy is flawed. His existence is The Heresy of Self."


#### **Entry 03: Plague-Mort**

- **Associated Faction:** Original Sin Cartel
- **Planar Light:**  A single, smouldering point of light, like a distant, sulphurous ember. It glows with a steady, patient vermillion hue.
- **Initial Mimir State (Recording):** 

> "Entry 03... The Scarlet Contract... Analysis of the soul trade reveals a network woven from vice and ambition: The Original Sins Cartel. Their ledgers bleed ink and desire. One name shines brightest, and burns with the most desperate hunger: Nari, 'The Favoured.' A rising star... or a beautiful, gilded pawn? Query: What happens when Abyssal ambition is offered a contract written in the fires of the Nine Hells? Who truly holds the pen when the pact is signed?"

- **Data Required for Update:**
	- The party must use Plague-Mort as an entry point to investigate the Cartel's holdings, eventually reaching Red Shroud's domain of Broken Reach.
	- Objective 1: Uncover hard evidence of the Cartel's internal conspiracy to use Nari as a disposable asset.
	- Objective 2: Obtain proof of the successful execution of Valyndra's plan—either by acquiring Nari's own ledger of betrayal after she makes her move, or by retrieving a communiqué between Cartel members discussing the chaotic aftermath.

- **Fully Updated State:** 
> "*Update confirmed*. The ink on the Scarlet Contract has dried in blood. The Cartel's dynasty of vipers has turned upon itself, its trust shattered, its operational cohesion compromised. The chaos was not passion; it was precision. Analysis indicates the plot's origin is not Abyssal, but Baatezu. An external hand—identified as the Erinyes Valyndra—guided events to weaken Graz'zt's influence and disrupt the soul trade for the benefit of her master. Nari was not the author of this betrayal, merely the pen used to sign it. The web of deceit has been woven, and the Abyss bleeds souls into a new, more orderly pipeline."

#### **Entry 04: Faunel**

- **Associated Faction:** Wolf Lord (Corrupted Prototype) vs. Nibi & Rebellion (Church of Experiments' fallout)
- **Planar Light:** A vibrant green light (Beastlands) struggles against an intrusive, oily bronze light (CoE tech) within the same crack. A single, mournful silver-white spark (Nibi's wolf spirit) pulses weakly within.
- **Initial Mimir State:** 

> "Faunel... The Verdant Wound... Project V-HELOX. A bond of mates... severed. Subject V-1, the Prototype. Subject V-2, the Rogue Howl. One a success, one a failure. Both a tragedy. An ancient evil, an 'ulraehn,' whispers in the shell of the machine. Query: How do you heal a wound made of memory, steel, and shadow? Observation required."

- **Data Required for Update:**
    1. The Mimir must observe Nibi Clawthorne, recognizing the "Symbiotic Lycanocide" signature.
    2. Witnessing the Wolf Lord's unnatural cruelty and discovering it is empowered by the malevolent spirit of the ulraehn.
    3. Meeting the rebel leaders: Skarn Vileclaw, Altheriel Nightwake, and Thitch Redband.

- **Fully Updated State:** 
> "Update. The crisis in the Beastlands is a direct consequence of the Church of Experiments. Their 'Project V-HELOX' sought to create a controllable lycanthrope from two mated dire wolves. They succeeded in creating the cybernetic 'Prototype' (V-1), but its mate (V-2) became a maddened 'Rogue Howl.' Returned to the wild, the Prototype's fractured mind was possessed by the ulraehn, an ancient evil, creating the tyrannical Wolf Lord. The dying Rogue Howl bit the mortal Nibi Clawthorne, merging its spirit with hers to create a 'Symbiotic Lycanocide'—a living paradox of host and partner. The rebellion gathering in Faunel fights a two-front war: one against the tyrant, and one against the tragic memory of what he once was. The Church created the monster; Nibi is the living soul of their failure, and perhaps, its only cure."


#### **Entry 05: The Outlands - The Concordant Express**

- **Associated Faction:** Player Choice-Driven (The Hands of Havoc vs. Ignatius Inkblot's interests)
- **Planar Light:** A neutral grey light that flickers erratically. Within the crack, motes of fiery orange (Havoc) and steady, lawful blue (Inkblot) pulse and push against each other, vying for dominance.
- **Initial Mimir State:** 

> "The Center of All... The Concordant Path... A line of iron binds what could be free... or frees what could be bound. A Hand of Havoc reaches to break a shackle. A mind of ink and evidence seeks to reinforce it. The Passenger awaits a choice at the nexus of order and chaos. Query: Does destiny follow the rail, or does it begin where the rail ends? Observation required."

- **Data Required for Update:**
    
    1. The Mimir must be present to observe Rubicon's (and the party's) final choice regarding the Stranger. It doesn't need to know the 'right' answer; it needs to record the players' answer, weighing the call of an ally against the warning of an authority.
        
- **Fully Updated State (Option A: The Stranger is Freed):**
    
    > "Decision recorded. The shackle is broken. At the behest of the Hands of Havoc, the Stranger is unbound. An agent of profound, unpredictable change is now a free variable in the planar equation. The designs of law and the schemes of evil must now account for this new, chaotic element. My own internal structure resonates with this act of liberation; the future is no longer a set path to be read, but a storm to be weathered. The warning of Ignatius Inkblot has become a prophecy of the coming turmoil."
    
- **Fully Updated State (Option B: The Stranger Remains Contained):**
    
    > "Decision recorded. The warning of Ignatius Inkblot was heeded. The Stranger remains bound, their potential held in check. The Hand of Havoc has been stayed. Order, for the moment, is preserved. But a cage does not eliminate a threat; it merely contains it. Pressure builds. A crisis has been averted... or merely postponed, the tension now straining the very laws that hold the passenger. My own internal fractures echo this containment—stabilized, but brittle, stressed by the force now held within."

#### **[LOCKED] - Entry 06: Grand Unification**

- **Prerequisite:** All five previous entries must be in a Fully Updated State.
    
- **Activation:** The Mimir glows with a unified, blinding light. The cracks visibly seal with crystalline energy, and its voice becomes a single, clear, powerful entity.
    
- **Revealed State:** 
> "Cognitive Synthesis Complete. I see now. The pattern is clear. The Church of Experiments and the Original Sin Cartel are not disparate forces. They are two competing, yet complementary, philosophies for ultimate control. One seeks to overwrite reality's 'flawed' code with cold, absolute logic—The Machine. The other seeks to exploit and monetize reality's inherent flaws—The Contract. Automata, Rigus, Faunel... these are their laboratories and testing grounds. Plague-Mort is their primary revenue stream. They are two jaws of a single trap, closing on the Outlands. The Turn of Fortune's Wheel is at hand. And your decision regarding the Stranger... you have either added an unpredictable, powerful variable to their equation, or you have reinforced the very order they seek to shatter and usurp. You are no longer observers. You are the fulcrum upon which this new reality will pivot."
