# Phase 1: Original Canon
## 1. Canonical Observation

The party originally experiences a full adventure spanning from levels 3 to X. Significant canonical event examples:

- The Master's transformation into a Necromaton.
- Warlock's patron shift, radically altering contracts.
- Numerous other adventures, challenges, and milestones forming their original story.

## 2. Tracing the Great Modron March

A contingent of modrons from **Mechanus**, including R04M, meticulously observes the entire canonical story.

The Great Modron March is a cornerstone of Mechanus's history. A contingent of modrons from **Mechanus**, including a monodrone named [[R04M]], meticulously observe events in the Outlands that would have a secondary, standing order: to gather any residual data or trace the path of the previous, ill-fated March. 

## 3. Visit to Iedcaru (The Walking Castle)

- The party might have been in a different part of the Outlands.
- [[R04M]], using his Mimir as a specialized data-gathering tool, traced an echo of the March to the repository of planar knowledge that is Zaythir's castle. He visited Zaythir not to record her, but to use the castle's location and knowledge to cross-reference data for his own mission.
- The Mimir's primary function for this task was complete. It had gathered all the trace data it could from the castle and its environs. Its internal logs now contained the precise coordinates for the next location on the March's trail: Gzemnid's Lair. Leaving the Mimir with Zaythir for safekeeping was a standard Modron procedure—a low-risk data deposit before rejoining his contingent for the next phase. He told her "it told him where to go next" because its calculations were complete. He intended to come back for it.

## 4. The Ambush at Gzemnid's Lair

- [[Shemeshka]], knowing the modrons' patterns, likely baited a trap. Perhaps she leaked information about a significant "canonical event" happening in Gzemnid's lair, a place of chaos perfectly suited for corrupting lawful creatures. The Modron contingent, including the recently-returned [[R04M]], went to investigate and record.
- She ambushes and imprisons the entire modron contingent. Her plan is to corrupt them all, exposing them to chaos and fiendish influences, then have them perform a verified, multi-modron upload of her manipulated narrative.

## 5. Desperate Escape and Failed Upload

- [[R04M]], manages a panicked and desperate escape from Gzemnid’s lair alone. Driven by a strong but flawed sense of duty, [[R04M]] believes he can single-handedly salvage the corrupted data.
- [[R04M]] reaches Mechanus prematurely, attempting a solitary, unauthorised upload.
	- Mechanus protocols require multi-level authorization and anti-corruption checks, which [[R04M]] cannot provide alone.
	- A chaotic and corrupted upload triggers a failsafe emergency procedure in Mechanus, partially rebooting reality to protect universal coherence.
	    - Reality reboots **around** the players, not **for** them. 

# Phase 2: The Glitched Reality

## 6. Partial Reality Reboot

Due to [[R04M]]'s flawed upload, reality reboots partially:

- **Scope of Reset:**
    - **Players' subjective experiences** are reset. They awaken abruptly in Sigil's Mortuary at level 3 with fragmented memories.
    - **The Modron contingent in Gzemnid's lair remains unaffected**. Their imprisonment is external to the rebooted events (as [[R04M]]’s data didn’t include their imprisonment).
- **Glitch Effects:**
    - NPCs experiencing déjà vu, inconsistencies, and paradoxical memory shifts.
    - Reality occasionally glitches, manifesting as strange distortions or inexplicable phenomena.
- **[[R04M]] retaining memories:**
	- Mechanus partially rejected his upload, fragments of data remain intact within him–he retains partial memories of the original timeline precisely because he was the source of the corrupted upload. 
	- Mechanus, acting defensively, rejected and expelled him without fully wiping his record.

## 7. Shemeshka's Reassessment and Recapture of R04M

**[[Shemeshka]]** is cosmically powerful and aware. The reality reboot is not something she fails to notice. Her original plan is in ruins, but she immediately realizes a new, more potent opportunity has emerged. [[R04M]] is no longer just a single modron; he is now The Glitch Incarnate. He is the living source code of the temporal distortion. He is infinitely more valuable than her original prisoners.

- [[Shemeshka]] didn't have to look far. A confused, corrupted, lone modron wandering Sigil is an anomaly that would be reported to her network of spies and enforcers almost immediately.
- Her agents (perhaps Harmonium patrols in her pocket, or mercenaries from the a casino) easily corner the disoriented [[R04M]]. He has no contingent, no support, and is suffering from the memory corruption he himself caused.
- She captures and imprisons him in her casino, **Fortune’s Wheel**, intending to study and perhaps leverage him as an insurance policy.
- [[Shemeshka]]'s awareness extends beyond the typical boundaries of a single reboot due to her potent planar influence and cosmic connections. When reality partially reset, she quickly identified [[R04M]] as a critical loose end, an unexpected side effect of her own meddling.

## 8. The Players' New Journey and Initial Adventures

Following their rebooted awakening:

- Players reacquaint themselves with **Sigil**, encountering early adventures (**The Eternal Boundary**) and dealing with initial confusion from fragmented memories.
- Gradually, they become aware that their memories are unreliable, with only brief glimpses of their previous life and future events.

## 9. Mechanus and The Fraternity of Order’s Response

The Grand Consensus and the Fraternity of Order quickly notice anomalies:

- Detecting temporal irregularities and unauthorized partial uploads, they issue arrest warrants for the players, viewing them as aberrations and threats to cosmic law and balance.
- The players must evade capture while discovering the truth behind their strange predicament.

## 10. R04M’s Escape from Fortune’s Wheel

When the players eventually arrive at **Fortune’s Wheel**, [[Shemeshka]]’s casino:

- [[R04M]] recognizes the players (though with fragmented, corrupted memories). He uses the casino's chaos as a distraction to orchestrate his escape.
- During his escape, [[R04M]] discreetly hands the players a cryptic parchment. 
- These coordinates guide the players to the **Mimir** in the Walking Castle.
	- Throughout their journey, the players will collect fragmented memories stored in a Mimir, a floating skull that acts as a data repository of lost history.
	- Installing these memory fragments into the main modron still imprisoned in Gzemnid's lair, allowing it to complete the upload and restore the true version of events.

## 11. The Players’ Mission to Restore the True Story

Players' main goals throughout the campaign become explicitly clear:

- **Rescue the corrupted modron contingent** still imprisoned within Gzemnid’s lair.
- **Retrieve fragmented memories** and upload them into the Mimir.
- Eventually, **return to Mechanus** alongside the modron contingent to perform the correct, verified upload, fully restoring narrative integrity and securing their adventures as canonical.


## 12. Progressive Antagonism of Shemeshka

Throughout the journey, [[Shemeshka]] progressively escalates her interference, especially when the agenda of the players clearly becomes saving the modrons:

- Initially appearing as a distant manipulator, [[Shemeshka]] intensifies attempts to thwart the players as they threaten her interests.
- Her mercenaries, secret alliances, and dangerous dealings constantly threaten the players' mission, maintaining pressure and tension.

## 13. Meta-narrative Theme and Final Resolution

- **The Glitch:** Represents corrupted narrative data and imperfect storytelling (from [[R04M]]’s incomplete upload).
- **The Upload:** Symbolizes "saving the game," validating experiences as canonical, and solidifying reality.
- Players’ final success ensures cosmic stability, correcting [[R04M]]’s flawed upload, and resolving temporal distortions.
