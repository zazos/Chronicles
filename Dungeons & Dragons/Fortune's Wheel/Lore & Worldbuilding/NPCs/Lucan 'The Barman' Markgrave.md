# Lucan Markgrave – Gunslinger Defender of the Fiend’s Salute

<img src="The Barman (refined).png" class="rightimg" height=500>

*A stoic, battle-hardened tavern keeper, Lucan runs the Fiend’s Salute with a steady hand and an unyielding presence.*

### **Who is The Barman?**

A former warrior turned guardian of his own domain, Lucan keeps the Salute fiend-free and orderly. He never starts fights but always finishes them. No one knows his past, but his legend is whispered among those who cross him. 

*Judgment isn’t just his rifle—it’s his philosophy.*
