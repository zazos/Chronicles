Intellectuals from three factions—the Athar, the Bleak Cabal, and the Mind’s Eye—are locked in debate in a public forum, such as the Trianym outside the Hall of Speakers. The quarrelers consist of a strident Athar null, an apathetic Bleak Cabal void soother, and an uplifting Mind’s Eye matter smith (see Morte’s Planar Parade for these stat blocks). Their dispute concerns the legitimacy of gods in the grand scheme of the multiverse. Their bombastic arguments have drawn a small crowd of spectators

#### **Three Arguments**

The crux of their arguments are as follows:

**The Athar** vigorously asserts that the gods are false powers, pointing to their dead husks in the Astral Sea as evidence that they’re unworthy of worship

**The Bleak Cabal** agrees with the Athar but goes on to say that nothing has meaning, not even this debate—the multiverse is a cruel existence.

**The Mind’s Eye** disagrees with both of the others, claiming that the gods are legitimate and that every individual can become one. True potential lies within; it’s an ingot waiting to be forged

**What do you think?**

Having reached an impasse, the philosophers turn their attention to the characters, asking them to weigh in. The debate resolves in one of three ways:

**One of You Is Right.** If the characters side with one of the three philosophers, that debater rejoices. Afterward, the agent invites them to tour their faction’s headquarters: the Shattered Temple (Athar), the Gatehouse (Bleak Cabal), or the Great Foundry (Mind’s Eye).

**Another Faction Is Right.** If the characters disagree and instead support another faction in Sigil, the philosophers dismiss the characters. Shortly afterward, a spectator in the crowd approaches the characters as a representative of that faction and invites them to the faction’s headquarters.

**None of You Are Right.** If the characters conclude that no faction is right, or support two or more arguments, the philosophers groan and disperse. A few stragglers hang around afterward to voice support for the characters’ new philosophy.

If the characters visit a faction headquarters, they’re provided details on the faction’s philosophies and welcomed to join, if they so choose. See Sigil and the Outlands for details on the factions.
