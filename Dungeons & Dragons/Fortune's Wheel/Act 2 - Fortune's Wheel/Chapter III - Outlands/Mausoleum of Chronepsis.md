# Prequel

The encounter starts while the characters are in the walking castle. There’s a boom and the castle sags, as if  
character investigates, read or paraphrase the following:

Coiled atop the walking castle is a mighty, pearl-colored **dragon** with branch-like horns. Its brilliant eyes fix on you. In a warm, slow voice that sounds as though it were coming from far away, it says, *“My old friend. How good it is to see you again.”*

This is **Renesnuprah**, an adult time dragon. Renesnuprah warmly greets the characters by name and calls them friends. She can share general details about each of them. Use the following details to guide the conversation with the time dragon:
- Renesnuprah claims to know the characters from when they first met hundreds of years ago. The characters have no memory of this meeting.
- The dragon realizes she might not have met the characters at this point in time. She doesn’t elaborate, as she fears interfering with events to come.
- Renesnuprah gives the characters a **talisman of the sphere** and says, *“Give this to the one who sees silver.”* She explains the characters will understand in time.

# Sequel

The encounter begins while the characters are in their walking castle, and they hear a panicked cry from outside. When a character investigates, read or paraphrase the following:

*A **cerulean dragon**—no bigger than a husky—frantically flaps its wings as it barrels toward the walking castle. It nearly crashes and quickly tries to hide amid the structure’s sculpted facade.*
*Pursing the dragon is a woman with wild gray hair streaked with crimson. She rides a flying, red broom and wears matching red goggles. An oversized birdcage dangles from her broom.”*


The dragon is **Renesnuprah**, now a **time dragon wyrmling** reduced to 10 hit points. The dragon quickly spots a character and begs to be hidden from the witch. If asked, the dragon refers to herself as Reenee.
The witch is **Trikante**, a neutral evil archmage on a broom of flying. Her mirrored goggles prevent others from seeing her eyes. She demands the characters give back her property. If asked, she shares the following details:
- She is Trikante, one of the greatest magical researchers the planes have ever known.
- She’s conducting magical experiments that are surely beyond the characters’ understanding.
- She purchased a time dragon for good money in the gate-town of Ribcage. The time dragon escaped, and she wants it back.

Reenee doesn’t elaborate, but the wyrmling knows Trikante has dire plans for her.
If the characters don’t stop Trikante, the mage easily recaptures Reenee and departs. If the characters intervene, she laughs but entertains trade offers. If the characters offer Trikante anything, she removes her goggles to get a better look. The character with the highest passive Wisdom (Perception) score
notices her **eyes are silver pools**. Trikante will accept any magic item of legendary rarity in trade, such as a **talisman of the sphere**. If she’s given such an item, she leaves Reenee alone and departs.

If the characters attack Trikante, she is a formidable foe. She fights until she’s allowed to reclaim the wyrmling or she’s reduced to 50 or fewer hit points, at which point she flees on her broom.

*After taking a moment to catch her breath, the wyrmling lets out a long sigh. “Woo wee! First it was thought I was a goner! Thanks bunches for helping me out. I’m Renee!” The dragon pauses and looks around uncertainly. “You wouldn’t know where home is, would ya?”*

Reenee was kidnapped and wants to get home, but she can’t tell the characters more. Extending the library's knowledge, Zaythir can inform the characters that the place this wyrmling call home is the **Mausoleum of Chronepsis**—lair of a god-like dragon with unique insights into draconic fate. 
Reenee wants to return home but she does not rush them–she's eager to stay with them as long as they like. 


# Ending

This event occurs when the characters near the Mausoleum of Chronepsis while the time dragon Reenee is with them. As soon as the mausoleum is within sight, read the following description:

*From an expanse of ruins and dragon bones rises a great fortress. On its towering facade, brilliant light beams from an opening shaped like an hourglass. High above wheel the silhouettes of soaring dragons.*

As soon as the mausoleum is in sight, Reenee asks the characters to stop the walking castle. She knows the dragons are territorial, and she doesn’t want to provoke them by bringing the castle closer. If the characters treated Reenee well, she thanks each character personally and gifts the group one of her scales. She then flaps off.

### Scales of Time

If Reenee leaves the characters one of her scales, as the characters are departing the Mausoleum of Chronepsis, read the following:

*As the walking castle strides away from the Mausoleum of Chronepsis, a shadow passes overhead. A massive shape settles atop a nearby ruin. It’s a gigantic, ancient-looking time dragon with huge, branching horns that pulse with opalescent energy. A voice like a whisper reaches you: “Call, and I’ll be there.”*

*With that, a portal of swirling colors opens around mighty dragon. The great wyrm fades into it, then the portal vanishes.*

The dragon is Renesnuprah as an ancient time dragon. She departs before the characters can act. The scale Reenee left begins to glow as it transforms into the following charm (Time of the Dragon)
