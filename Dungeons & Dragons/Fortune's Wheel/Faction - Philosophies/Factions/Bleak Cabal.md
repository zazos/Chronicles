*Who Find No Sense in the Multiverse*

**Factol**: Lhar

**Headquarters**: Gatehouse

**Aligned Plane**: Pandemonium

**Members**: Consolers, healers, nihilists

**Epithet**: Bleakers


To the Bleak Cabal, the quest for cosmic meaning is futile—the multiverse doesn’t make sense, and it isn’t supposed to. With no greater truth, individuals must derive their own meaning from the multiverse. This introspection kindles empathy and kindness in many Bleakers, who commit themselves to easing the suffering of others. Existence is merciless, so the Bleak Cabal must show mercy in its stead.

Bleakers tend to those overcome by the strange realities of the Outer Planes, which exert their influence on travelers who wander past their boundaries.

The Bleak Cabal rehabilitates creatures that have been stricken with planar curses, glimpsed mind-shattering expanses, or ventured into the howling darkness of Pandemonium.

Factol Lhar (chaotic good, orc gladiator) surveys the citizens of Sigil with growing concern. Lhar works to expand the Bleak Cabal’s charitable influence. Under his direction, the Bleak Cabal has opened community kitchens throughout the city where hungry citizens can get a free hot meal. However, some factions don’t view this expansion as benevolent. Lhar moves carefully, always looking for like-minded individuals to further his cause.

**Faction Attire**. Bleakers dress in gloomy, drab color schemes. Frayed clothing and weather-beaten gear are common.

**Role in Sigil**. The Bleak Cabal’s headquarters is the Gatehouse, a fortress of healing and respite in the Hive Ward. Bleakers offer sanctuary to anyone in need, notably to those afflicted by planar maladies. The Bleak Cabal’s philosophy puts them at odds with the Fraternity of Order, Harmonium, and Mercykillers—if there’s no meaning, there can’t be order. Conversely, the Doomguard, Hands of Havoc, and Heralds of Dust all find enough common points with Bleakers to call them allies.

## Oh, What's the Sodding Point?

A faction who don’t even bother to preach, the Bleakers just resign themselves to facing life as it heaps its woes upon them. There’s no Grand Meaning of Life, no Hidden Truth, not even a morsel of Hope left. Life just happens, and then it stops. Happy now?

Being slapped in the face with your own insignificance and mortality doesn’t do most cutters much good. In fact, the Bleakers take it upon themselves to look after the ones whose tiny insignificant egos couldn’t face being pointless and lost the plot. They’re all cared for in the Bleaker’s **Gatehouse**. Charitable sods, the factioneers also set up soup kitchens throughout the poorest areas of the Cage to care for the poor, the destitute and the down-on-their-luck. Just because there’s no meaning to life, it don’t mean you shouldn’t help feed a hungry mouth, berk!

So the Bleak Cabal take events as they come, trying to keep a grip on their sanity in a Multiverse slowly losing its own head. In time people will realise, when they finally get sick of looking for the elusive Answers. They’ll never be found because they were never lost, see? They never even existed. And the sooner cutters realise this, the less suffering there’ll be in the end…
