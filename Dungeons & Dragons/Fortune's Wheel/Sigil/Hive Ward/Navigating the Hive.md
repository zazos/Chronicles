# **Navigating the Hive: Touts & Traversable Roads**

![[The Hive panoramic.webp|700]]

The Hive is no place for casual wanderers. Without a tout, a soul risks not just getting lost—but being forgotten. These guides are rare, reluctant, and irreplaceable.

### Touts: The Unofficial Lifelines

- Most touts refuse Hive jobs—too dangerous, too chaotic.
- The few who will guide through the Hive charge dearly.
- A tout grants **immunity from Disentangle**, keeps PCs oriented, and knows safe pauses (places you can breathe).

> **Disentangle (Hive Malus):**  
> While in the Hive without a tout, players suffer **disadvantage on all Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma checks**.  
> Their intentions become fuzzy. Maps seem wrong. Language loses meaning. Each action feels unmoored.

### Main Roads: The Barely Safe Paths

Some routes through the Hive _exist_, marked by those who braved them and lived. But they are not truly safe—only **less fatal**.

- **Mawbone Road:** Yellow-painted Dustman sigils mark this trail. Avoids most gangs but runs close to barmy warrens.
- **Gutterglass Way:** Subterranean runoff tunnels. Cramped, damp, and likely to house _something_.
- **Bell Paths:** Old routes hung with bone bells. If one rings, something is watching—don’t move, don’t speak.
- **The Rust Line:** A trail of blood-rusted pipes once used by [[The Red Circuit]] runners. Quiet, but watched.

Even these paths, without a tout, expose travellers to Disentangle.
