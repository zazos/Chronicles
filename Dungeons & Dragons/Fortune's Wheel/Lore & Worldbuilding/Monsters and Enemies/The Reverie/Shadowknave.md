traits:
- [Sneak Attack (1/turn), "Shadowknave deals an extra 14 (4d6) damage when he hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of Shadowknave that isn't incapacitated and he doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll."]
- [Evasion, "If Shadowknave is subjected to an effect that allows him to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, he instead takes no damage if he succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if he fails."]
- [Cunning Action, "On each of his turns, Shadowknave can use a bonus action to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action."]
- [Uncanny Dodge, "When an attacker that Shadowknave can see hits him with an attack, he can use his reaction to halve the attack's damage against him."]
- [Dagger of Venom, "You gain +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. You can use an action to cause thick, black poison to coat the blade. The poison remains for 1 munute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 2d10 poison damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. This dagger can't be used this way again until the next dawn."]
