# First Encounter with the Red Circuit: The Fiend's Salute Ambush

The first known appearance of the Red Circuit in the campaign occurred during an ambush at the Fiend’s Salute tavern. The assault was orchestrated by [[Shadowknave]], a mercenary with extensive underworld connections, though he himself is not a member of the Red Circuit. Instead, he had the jink and the contacts to hire a small kill-team of Rust Fangs—low-ranked but dangerous mercenaries from the Crimson Fangs division of the Pact.

His objective was clear: to eliminate a particular group of individuals in exchange for a hefty sum of coin and access to rare cybernetic tech—items he had observed firsthand during a prior encounter with the party, particularly in connection to [[LO]].


### **Yrrik, The Bomb Rat**

- **Race:** Goblin
- **Role:** Bomber and Chemical Warfare Enthusiast
- **Personality:** Chaotic, unhinged, obsessed with watching things explode.
- **Equipment:**
    - **A handful of gas bombs** (various effects—incendiary, corrosive, and hallucinogenic).
    - [[Respirator Mask.webp]]—a dirty, heavily modified rebreather with patched tubing and a cracked visor.
    - [[Goblin-encrypted earpiece.webp]]—a **highly encrypted comm device**, potentially holding valuable information on the Red Circuit’s activities.
    - [[Skippy1]]

Yrrik was a deranged explosives enthusiast, and his combat style reflected it—lobbing gas bombs into crowded spaces and laughing maniacally as chaos unfolded. His respirator mask and earpiece suggested he had a direct line to other members of the Pact, hinting at a deeper network of communication among their ranks.

### **Varkash, The Silent Blade**

- **Race:** Hobgoblin
- **Role:** Stealth Melee Combatant
- **Personality:** Cold, methodical, disciplined—a stark contrast to Yrrik’s madness.
- **Equipment:**
    - [[Twin Monoknives.webp]]—two razor-thin, monomolecular vibroblades capable of cutting through most armor with ease.
    - [[Tactical Combat Chip.webp]]—a compact, rectangular implant designed to slot seamlessly into the forearm.
        - **If repaired and installed:** Grants **+1 to initiative** due to enhanced reaction speed.

Varkash fought silently and efficiently, his movements honed like a professional assassin. Unlike the others, he was calculating, likely aiming to survive long enough to ascend into the ranks of the Blood Fangs. His Tactical Combat Chip—though damaged—suggests he was already modifying himself beyond standard military-grade cyberware.

### **Karesh, The Bruiser**

- **Race:** Hobgoblin
- **Role:** Heavy Melee Enforcer
- **Personality:** Brutal, sadistic, enjoys overpowering weaker opponents.
- **Equipment:**
    - [[Electroshiv.webp]]—a compact, high-voltage dagger capable of delivering **paralytic shocks** upon contact.
    - [[Neural Override Implant.webp]]—a dangerous, high-risk device installed at the base of the skull.
        - If repaired and installed: Grants +1 to melee attack rolls when at half HP or lower (potential for further enhancement if modified).

Karesh was a walking wall of muscle and cybernetic reinforcement, preferring up-close, vicious melee combat. His Neural Override Implant hints at unstable tech, likely an untested experimental enhancement from the Church.


#### **Goblin-Encrypted Earpiece**

This military-grade earpiece was found on Yrrik, though he was not its original owner—it bore scratches, dents, and a nameplate that had been forcefully removed.

- The device is encrypted, meaning LO must decrypt it in order to uncover its secrets.
- Possible intel within the earpiece could include:
    - Messages from higher-ranking Pact members.
    - Potential Red Circuit contracts & meeting locations.
    - Details on Pact operations and their connection to the Church of Experiments.
- If successfully decrypted, this earpiece could expose Red Circuit operations, making it a valuable asset—or a highly dangerous liability if discovered by the wrong people.
