### **What is a Sibilith?**

A **Sibilith** is a unique type of **devil found exclusively in Cania**, the **frozen realm of Mephistopheles.** They are **serpentine masterminds**, creatures of **arcane manipulation, deception, and intricate political games.**

Unlike other devils, **Sibiliths do not command through raw power**—they twist words like weapons, weave illusions into reality, and coil their influence around mortals and fiends alike.

### **Who is Irmara?**

Irmara the Gilded Serpent is one of **Mephistopheles' most cunning and insidious operatives,** a master of infernal contracts, whispered secrets, and **corrupting the powerful through wealth and arcane knowledge.**

She operates as **the Grand Chancellor of Cania**, effectively managing Mephistopheles' diplomacy with the other Archdukes of Hell. While Mephistopheles is obsessed with mastering arcane supremacy, **Irmara ensures his ambitions are not undermined by politics, trade, or the constant infighting of the Nine Hells.**

**Visage & Presence:**

- - **A towering, regal serpentine figure**, standing nearly **ten feet tall**, her lower body that of a **great golden-scaled serpent, covered in runes that shift like liquid gold.**
- **Her upper body is lithe and humanoid**, her skin resembling **smooth obsidian veined with fiery red sigils.**
- Her **six arms**, all adorned with **golden rings of infernal authority**, move with eerie precision, each capable of weaving enchantments with the flick of a finger.
- **A cobra-like hood fans out behind her head**, shimmering in a pattern of abyssal blue and hellfire red.
- **Her eyes are pools of molten gold**, flickering like coins tumbling into an endless pit.
- She wears **jewels and silks that seem to slither and change form**, shifting between elegant courtly attire and an armored battle-dress at will.

### **Her Role in Mephistopheles' Plans**

- Irmara is **not just a manipulator—she is a _kingmaker_.**
- She ensures that **Mephistopheles' rivals never gain too much ground in the infernal hierarchy** while subtly **maneuvering the soul trade away from Asmodeus' direct control.**
- Unlike Valyndra, who is a military-minded erinyes enforcing Asmodeus' will, **Irmara is a grand schemer, weaving webs so intricate that even devils find themselves lost in them.**

### **Why She Needs Darius**

- Unlike Valyndra, **who uses Orianna as a direct weapon,** Irmara sees Darius as **an agent of subterfuge.**
- He must **not simply destroy the Cartel, but infiltrate it, bend it, and turn it against Asmodeus.**
- If successful, **Mephistopheles will hold the reins of the multiversal soul trade**, a move that could make him _strong enough to finally challenge Asmodeus._

### **How She Controls Darius**

- **"You are not free, Darius. You were never free. But your chains are of the finest gold—ornate, beautiful, and worthy of admiration. Would you trade such power for the rusted irons of mortality?"**
- Irmara operates through **suffocating contracts and deals that seem beneficial but are riddled with hidden clauses.**
- She **never threatens outright—she _reminds_ Darius of how much she has given him, how much he still owes.**
- Her **punishments are subtle,** degrading his power little by little, ensuring he knows what true _coldness_ feels like when she turns away from him.
