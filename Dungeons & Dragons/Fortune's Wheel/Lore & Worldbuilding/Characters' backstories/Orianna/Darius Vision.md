### **_A Dream of Fire and Whispers_**

The air is thick with heat. Orianna stands in a **crimson void,** weightless, the world shifting like smoldering ash. Then—**Valyndra descends.**

Her wings fold like obsidian blades, her eyes burning **twin orbs of judgment.** She does not speak immediately. She does not need to.

_"You sought the demonologist."_

A vision shudders into place—**a man, cloaked in plain sight.** No infernal sigils, no marks of the Abyss—yet his hands have traced **forbidden glyphs.** His voice has stirred **what should remain silent.**

The image sharpens.

_"Darius."_

His name is spoken **without malice, without delight—only certainty.**

_"Your steps now run parallel to his, little one. But know this—_"

A **low, unseen breath** rolls through the void, vast and watching.

_"You must tread carefully."_

Valyndra steps closer, and the air grows heavy.

_"He is more than he appears. More than even _he_ knows. His path is knotted in the fates of things far older than you or I."_

Her voice lowers, edged with something far worse than anger—**warning.**

_"Do not act in haste. Do not act in ignorance. Watch. Listen. Know."_

The dream fractures. The heat rises. The weight of her words lingers.

_"If he is to fall… it will not be by accident."_

And then—**silence.**
