#### **The Power Players**

- **Asmodeus (Lord of the Nine Hells)** – The ultimate ruler of Hell and the final authority on the soul trade. He sees all challengers as _temporary_ and all victories as _inevitable_.
- **Mephistopheles (Archduke of Cania)** – Master of forbidden magic and Hell’s greatest schemer. He wishes to **strip Asmodeus of his final source of dominance—control over the multiversal soul trade.**
- **Valyndra (Asmodeus’ Pawn, Orianna’s Patron)** – A ruthless erinyes general who believes the best way to **win favor in Hell is to bring all souls under Asmodeus’ dominion.**
- **Irmara (Mephistopheles’ Pawn, Darius’ Patron)** – A Paeliryon devil who **presents herself as a master manipulator of infernal politics** but secretly serves **Mephistopheles’ mission to undermine Asmodeus.**

#### **The Wild Card: The Original Sin Cartel**

- **Abyssal Succubi Lords control nearly 10% of all souls sent to the Abyss.**
- Their power has **disrupted the stability of Hell’s soul trade, drawing the ire of both Archdukes.**
- **Both Valyndra and Irmara want the Cartel destroyed,** but for _very different_ reasons.

#### **The Warlocks: Caught in the Crossfire**

- **Orianna (Valyndra’s Warlock)** – Assigned to **infiltrate and dismantle the Cartel from within.**
- **Darius (Irmara’s Warlock)** – Ordered to **watch Orianna, assist in disrupting the Cartel, and ensure the resulting power vacuum doesn’t favor Asmodeus.**

Neither **knows the full truth.**

- **Orianna doesn’t realize she is serving Asmodeus’ interests.**
- **Darius doesn’t know that his patron serves Mephistopheles.**
- **Both warlocks initially trust that their masters have the same goal—ending the Cartel.**
