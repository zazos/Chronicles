# Keywords

- **CII (Carbon Intensity Indicator):** An operational measure implemented by the IMO that rates how efficiently a ship transports goods or passengers. It is given in grams of CO2 emitted per cargo-carrying capacity and nautical mile. Ships are rated A (best) to E (worst).
- **EEXI (Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index):** A technical design standard for existing ships, requiring them to meet a certain level of energy efficiency compared to a baseline.
- **FLEET-AI (Federated Learning for Enhanced Environmental & Technical C-suite Intelligence):** The title of the proposed use-case, emphasizing its focus on using federated AI to deliver high-level, actionable insights for both environmental compliance and technical management.
- **GreenAI:** The practice of applying Artificial Intelligence to solve environmental challenges, specifically focusing on increasing energy efficiency, reducing emissions, and promoting sustainability.
- **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators):** A set of quantifiable measures used to gauge a company's or project's performance against its key strategic and operational goals.
- **OPEX (Operational Expenditures):** The ongoing costs required for the day-to-day functioning of a business or asset, such as fuel, crew salaries, and maintenance parts for a vessel.
- **PdM (Predictive Maintenance):** A proactive maintenance strategy that uses data analysis and machine learning to detect anomalies in operation and predict potential equipment failures before they occur.

# Previous Proposals

- **SHIPROTECT:** Focused on **Federated Learning for Predictive Maintenance (PdM)**. Its strength was using FL to protect data privacy while training models to predict machinery failures, thereby reducing downtime and costs. The environmental benefit was positioned as a secondary outcome of improved engine health.
- **RAMOS:** Proposed a broad **Edge Intelligence architecture**. Its most relevant use-case was **"Just in Time Arrival,"** an AI-driven voyage optimization to reduce fuel consumption. This directly targets GreenAI but was part of a much larger, more abstract framework.
- **COSMICos:** Also presented a large-scale **Decentralized Operating System**. For Laskaridis (LASK), it combined **Predictive Maintenance and AI Optimization** for sustainability. It correctly identified the need to align with IMO's net-zero strategy.
