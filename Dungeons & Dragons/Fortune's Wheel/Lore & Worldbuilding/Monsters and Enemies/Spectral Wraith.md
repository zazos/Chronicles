- [Drowned Remembrance (1/Day), "The wraith utters the name of a long-dead noble soul buried in the crypt. Creatures within 10 feet who knew reverent rites or carry relics of the dead must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of their next turn."]

Targets that fail are unable to speak or cast spells with verbal components until the end of their next turn."]
