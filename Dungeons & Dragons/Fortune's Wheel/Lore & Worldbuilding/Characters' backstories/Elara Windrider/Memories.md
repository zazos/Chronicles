Elara's consciousness expanded beyond the boundaries of the material world. She found herself within the ethereal expanse of the Astral Plane, where thoughts and memories converged in the vast, collective-consciousness of the multiverse.

Amidst the swirling silvery mists, she witnessed a gathering of enigmatic beings, each a manifestation of forgotten thoughts and distant memories. These entities seemed to resonate with the Astral Plane's power, their luminous forms flickering like stars in the astral sea.

Elara's presence went unnoticed by the astral entities, allowing her to observe their ethereal discourse. They conversed in a language that transcended words, a symphony of thoughts and emotions that resonated through the astral currents. 

In the midst of this gathering, an entity of radiant light and boundless wisdom stood at the center. This being emanated an aura of profound knowledge, and Elara felt an irresistible pull towards it.

As the astral beings continued their discourse, Elara's attention was drawn to a specific memory, a scene unfolding within the radiant entity's luminous form. It was a vision of cosmic significanceâ€”a past event that echoed through the multiverse.

In the vision, Elara witnessed an abyssal battle of cosmic proportions. Six individuals clashed with nightmarish monstrosities of putrid darkness. The battle was fought in an inner chamber where, a long iron scepter with a human skull set into one end. The wand sit upon a pedestal in the center of the cavern, and the entrances were sealed with invisible barriers, trapping everyone inside. 

The choreography of this clash was fuzzy, glitchy. Not everything made sense, but after a while, a shadowy form raced through the tunnels with frantic speed, arriving at the scene. A monstrous form that exuded a sense of dread and despair, threating to plunge not only them, but the multiverse into darkness.

These beings launched a valiant assault to prevent That from acquiring what was once Theirs. Their determination and sacrifice echoed through the Astral Plane, leaving an indelible mark on the collective-consciousness. 

As the vision unfolded, the luminous entity at the center of the astral gathering seemed to resonate with Elara's presence, and she felt a deep connection to the event. The vision culminated in a blinding burst of blazing hot, toxic liquid, like blood, as the final strike had been dealt and it's toothy mouth of its gray, wraithlike face opened wide and let out a soul-wrenching scream, beginning growing in size and substance, when finally this ram-headed humanoid, contorted in horror and pain, exploded.

Finally, the luminous entity that showed Elara this vision, spoke in a gentle, stoic, male voice "Do not meddle with the past, curious one. We forgot about it, you should too."
