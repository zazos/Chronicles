*Who Take All They Can and More*

![[FactionFated5e.webp | 300]]

**Factol**: Duke Rowan Darkwood

**Headquarters**: Hall of Records

**Aligned Plane**: Ysgard

**Members**: Bullies, moguls, warlords

**Epithet**: Takers

To the Fated, the multiverse belongs to those with the strength to take it. Destiny and the will of the gods are poor excuses used by folk too weak to go after what they want—everyone makes their own fate. At the same time, nothing’s free. It takes work, dedication, and sometimes blood to seize greatness.

There’s no inherent malice in the Fated’s philosophy. It takes more than material wealth to provide for one’s needs, and not everything worth having can be taken by force. Respect and happiness, for example, must be earned (or bought). Still, Takers are branded as callous and selfish, if not outright feared, and they never offer assistance willingly unless it benefits them in some way.

Factol Rowan Darkwood (chaotic neutral, human archmage) holds the reins of the Fated in his tightfisted grip. “Duke” Darkwood, as he’s sometimes known, is a commanding presence whose every step is an implacable stride toward his next prize. With brutal efficiency, he exploits the financial stranglehold his faction has over Sigil, richly rewarding informants for secrets that might give the Fated leverage over the other factions.

**Faction Attire**. Takers dress in ostentatious outfits marked by heavy embroidery. They sport elaborate hairstyles, and each member carries an hourglass of golden sand—a reminder that time is money.

**Role in Sigil**. Secure in the Hall of Records, the Fated cement their role as the tax collectors of the Cage. Their ruthless debt collection efforts and aggressive foreclosures earn them a heaping share of animosity. They have bad blood with the Harmonium, who view the Fated as wrongheaded and dangerous, and Factol Darkwood and Factol Montgomery of the Society of Sensation are bitter rivals.

## Help Yourself ...

‘Cos I ain’t going to lift a finger to aid you. So think the **Fated**, called ‘the Heartless’ by many. But they’re not all evil; far from it. You’d not call the plane of **Bytopia** _evil_ now, would you, and locals there have a very similar attitude —don’t rely on charity, because it’s fickle. Strive to do things your way, and make others depend on you, so you can call in the favours later. Be generous by all means, but remember that all debts have to be paid in the end.

Cutters in **Sigil** fear the Fated as much, if not more than, the **Mercykillers**. See, the Fated have this knack of remembering things they’re owed, and finding ways to take as much of their share as possible. Default on a loan repayment? Better not answer the door when the Fated come knocking to collect it.

On the Prime, they have a saying: “Elephants never forget”. Who knows what that’s supposed to mean, but in Sigil, they say something else: “A Taker Never Forgets”. And better believe it’s true.

## Coteries

> “There are two kinds of Fated. The first are those that argue that since they’ve worked hard for something, they deserve it. These kinds don’t believe in luck or fortune, and they strive to be independent.
> 
> “The second kind, like myself, argues that if they’ve taken something, that act clearly shows that they’ve earned what they’ve taken. We tend to be a bit more ruthless, but hey, who’s counting?”
