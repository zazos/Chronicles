# 1 - The Front Gate

The main entrance of the Mortuary is an impressive double door of copper-sheathed ironwood, left ajar during the day but closed and barred by night. The gate is always guarded by a squad of Dustmen. 

*A shallow flight of marble steps sweeps up between two of the building's dark buttresses to a massive gate of copper- sheathed wood. Two small stone guardhouses stand at the bottom of the stairs. Several Dustmen guards watch your approach. As you approach, one of the guards asks, "Well, what d'you want with us?"* 


Six Dustmen guard this entrance. Two are stationed in the guardhouses, two beneath the arch (at points left and right of the floor of the entrance stairs), and two more in front of the gate. A captain supervises the detail, stationing himself near the arch. If any trouble breaks out, one of the guards goes inside to Area 4 to get help. The Dustmen aren't in a hurry to start a fight, but they won't be bulldozed, either. Their job is to find out the visitors' business and point them in the right direction, and to defend the Mortuary from any direct attack. Parties with unidentified bodies are directed to the back door and told to knock, funeral processions are directed to Area 4.

# 2 - The Lesser Gate

The Dustmen use this entrance to receive deliveries. It is much smaller than the Main Gate and not often used. 

*A flight of narrow steps leads up to a sturdy iron-plated door, located between two black buttresses. No guards are in sight. A priest of the Dustmen, assigned as door warden, answers your knock. He has two zombies in tow and opens the door slightly to see if you are turning in a body. "Do you wish to see the interment?" he asks.
The request is not authorized because credentials are missing or invalid.The request is not authorized because credentials are missing or invalid.
The gate is customarily left locked but unguarded when not in use. In addition to the lock, the door is also secured by a heavy iron bar. If the door is forced open, it makes a huge racket that brings the priest, zombies, and two guards from Area 12 to investigate in 1 d4 rounds

# 3 - Public Memorial

This building is an open-air monument. For a fee, the Dustmen will add deceased persons' names to the Roll of the Dead. Over centuries, the memorial has be- come full of the tiny carved names. (None of the barmies are memorialized.) The Dustmen pay no attention to anyone in here unless something bizarre occurs.
*Four tall arches lead into an open-air chamber of black marble. A single stone monument stands in the center of the room. In each corner an oil-fueled brazier burns. The walls of the room are made of polished granite and are covered with thousands of finely carved names in various languages.*

**LO's backstory appearance**: Since the destruction of *The Master's* laboratory, [[Bob the Blob.webp|Bob the Blob]] magically teleported to the ditch of Sigil, in the Hive Ward. Several Dustmen collected the remains of Bob and tried to stitch him anew. Bob's body has been partially repaired, and in some ways enhanced, but his souls remains the same, joyful as always.
In remembrance of his old pals, he wrote their names to the Memorial: LO and Clyve, Carila and of course the Krell brothers

# 4 - Great Hall

This chamber is used to receive guests or funeral par- ties of importance. It is kept spotless and reserved for ceremonial use only. Five Dustmen stand guard here and also act as guides for any visitors who need to be taken to a different part of the building. At night, only two are on duty.
*This impressive chamber features a tall, vaulted ceiling and a floor of polished black marble. The walls are decorated with dark, geometric carvings. Five [or two, depending on time of day] Dustmen wait patiently here. They offer their assistance to you upon your approach.*
The Dustmen will send for any person the PCs request to see, or take them to any portal they wish to view. If a fight starts, one of the Dustmen heads for Area 12 to get help. In a real pinch, the priest will step into Area 6 and attempt to command the armored skeletons there.

# 5 - Interment Chambers

These rooms contain portals leading to various places in neutral planes, including Mechanus, Acheron, Arcadia, Limbo, Pandemonium, and Ysgard. Dozens of additional portals are available for more inaccessible areas of these planes in the catacombs, but the Dustmen find that most of their customers' needs can be met with these general portals. In addition to the neutral planes included in these chambers, several portals lead to the more prominent prime- material worlds.

*This room is paved with dark flagstones and roofed with heavy stone vaults. Blank doorways carved in stone line the walls. Empty torch sconces and black wall hangings indicate that this room may be used for ceremonies from time to time. The ceiling is so low that those of you who are tall are forced to stoop to avoid hitting your head. In the center of the chamber is a blank stone slab suspended by chains from the ceiling, allowing it to be faced toward any of the portals. It can be tilted to slide a body into the appropriate portal.*

# 6 - Central Chamber

This large chamber is not used in any burial ceremonies. Instead, it is reserved for gatherings of Dustmen and receives heavy traffic.

*Four vaulted pillars rise to meet in an opening in the ceiling overhead. Red and black marble flagstones coper the floor in an intricate pattern. Trophies, banners, and coats of arms hang from each wall, displaying various Dustmen triumphs. In each corner stand a pair of huge skeletons in ancient bronze armor. They do not react to your presence.*
The skeletons are animated hill giant skeletons, but their orders are to defend themselves only if attacked, and to make sure that no one defaces or removes any of the decorations in 
this chamber. As long as the PCs mind their manners, the skeletons remain inanimate.

# 7 - Memorial Hall

The Dustmen are occasionally paid to let a body lie in state and arrange for viewings. This chamber is used for that purpose. Currently, no one is being honored in this fashion.

*A tall brass candelabra stands in each corner of this room. In the center of the chamber there is a large stone bier with a glass cover, it is unoccupied. The floor is highly polished marble tile showing signs of wear*

# 8 - Antechamber

This room is similar to Area 7. If the Dustmen arrange more than one viewing at a time, they'll use this room as a secondary chamber of state. It is also heav- ily used, and there is a Id6 chance per turn that a party of Id4 Dustmen passes through on an errand.

# 9 - Storage rooms

A number of small, locked rooms can be found scattered throughout the Mortuary. There are all kinds of interesting things in these chambers.
- Cleaning supplies, blankets, linen.
- Food and drink, including sacks of grain, barrels of salted meat, tuns of wine, casks of brandy, and a few normal rats.
- Weapons and armor, including partial suits of chain mail and scale mail, shields, helms, crossbows, bolts, spears, and short swords.
- Burial materials, including assembled coffins, vats of embalming chemicals, and ceremonial trappings suitable for a variety of customers.
- 2d6 zombies or skeletons awaiting orders from a Dustman. There is a 25% chance that the last orders they received were to attack intruders.

# 10 - Vaults

Thousands of bodies are buried in or beneath the Mortuary. Most of these are interred in the catacombs, but a number lie in the black mausoleums that surround the Dust- men headquarters. The ancient vaults are said to predate the Mortuary itself. The following is a description of a typical vault.

*Doors of bronze plate, carved with hideous images and dire curses upon anyone disturbing the vault's occupants, guard this chamber. Inside, the walls contain scores of burial niches, most of them occupied. There are six niches in each 10 x 10-foot wall section, and the vault is two or three stories high. It must contain more than 100 ancient corpses! It has a central sarcophagus of great size, covered with carvings that fill you with fear. You feel as though you're being watched by a malicious presence, and the bones of the corpses creak most disturbingly as you walk by.*

Obviously, PCs intruding in this area arouse the wrath of the undead.

# 11 - Toranna's Vault

Toranna explored the vaults when she first enlisted in the Dustmen, but had to flee for her life from most of them. However, she found one vault that was free of any horrible undead. She uses this chamber for storing things she doesn't want other Dustmen to find — such as the PCs if they get captured. At the moment, the only things here are four skeletons that attack anyone who enters, and Toranna's cache that is placed inside the empty sarcophagus. It includes a map showing a rough layout of the Mortuary, with the portal leading to the Elemental Plane of Fire circled; a journal listing all the bodies that were diverted to the Rock instead of being incinerated normally (there are almost 40 names in the list, including Eliath and Tylaric); a letter from Veylith to Toranna, including his orders to her; a scrap of paper with the phrase "Shadowknave at the Blood Pit, 8 o'clock"; a potion of healing, a potion of undead control, a potion of invisibility, an oil of elemental invulnerability (fire), a scroll of protection from undead, and a change of clothes. The letter from Veylith reads: 

*"Toranna - Congratulations on your success in joining the Dustmen. You're made excellent progress. As we discussed earlier, the Eternal Boundary plan is now in process. Look for marks behind the right ear of unknown or unidentifiable corpses, and make sure that they are cremated in the Elemental Plane of Fire, using the portal we identified. Move quickly; the sods'll revive in sir or eight hours, and that would be unfortunate. Best wishes, Veylith."*

If the PCs have been captured, Toranna binds them securely and locks them in this room with four skeletons as guards.

# 12 - Guardroom 

This is the entrance to the faction headquar- ters area. A squad of six Dustmen are always on duty here. There aren't any good reasons for the PCs to be here, and the Dustmen react appropriately.

*This chamber represents a distinct change in architecture from the vaults of the Mortuar\'- It is newer and decorated in somber colors. A group of Dustmen are sitting at a table play- ing a game of chance. They immediately see you and get up. "You're not supposed to be here," one says.*
The guards attack the PCs unless they come up with a very good explanation for their presence. Even if the PCs manage to excuse themselves without a fight, the guards think about it for a round or two and then decide that they'd better follow the party and look into things.

# 13 - Faction Records

At night, this office is locked and unoccupied. During the day, Id4 Dustmen and a priest work here. Non-Dustmen are prohibited from this area.

*This small office features a number of huge filing cabinets, stuffed with all kinds of documents. Several Dustmen clerks are trying to sort papers. As you enter, they look up and ask in surprise, "Who are you?"*

The chief function of this office is to keep a record of every interment performed by the Dustmen. In addition, records concerning faction membership are kept here. It will take a PC about two hours to find the date, time, and location of any particular burial. (Most of the barmies have been in- terred in the last six weeks.) If a clerk can be forced to help in the effort, it will only take about 15 minutes to find the information.

# 14 - Faction Library

At night this room is locked and unoccupied. During the day Id6 Dustmen supervised by a priest and a mage are here, performing research on various topics. The small room adjacent to the library is a wizard locked and contains the faction's rare volumes.

*This room is a library. Crowded bookshelves line the walls, and huge wooden tables in the center of the room are covered with various tomes and treatises. Several Dustmen are here, absorbed in their own studies. As you enter, they glance up and ask, "Hey, are you supposed to be here?*

Under no circumstances will the PCs be allowed to start looking through the volumes unless they have an escort of Dustman, and a high-up one at that. The library is mostly concerned with burial practices and sites, the undead, philosophical works on death, and lists of gravesites. The rare volumes include dozens of especially valuable books (any of them would be worth 100 to 600 gp to a collector), plus several tomes on necromantic magic. Several contain spells and potion ingredient lists. If a fight breaks out, the Dustmen are careful not to damage any volumes. The guards from Area 12 come running to join the fray, arriving in two rounds.

# 15 - Refectory

Most of the lower-ranking Dustmen gather here for meals. During the day, a few Dustmen are almost always here. At night the place is usually empty.

*Wooden tables line the walls of this long, narrow hall. Banners and coats of arms decorate the walls, but most are very dark and somber. Almost a dozen Dustmen are assembled around the various tables. Unlike most gatherings, the mood is very sober and quiet. Conversations come to a stop as you enter the room. Finally, one captain stands up. "Who are you and what d'you think you're doing here?" he demands. Other Dustmen begin to rise, hands on swordhilts.*

Again, the PCs may be able to fast-talk their way out of this jam if they can offer a reasonable explanation and im- mediately retreat in a different direction. The Dustmen may believe the heroes to be a mourning party that took the wrong turn. If the PCs don't lie quickly and convincingly, the Dustmen will try to capture or kill them. There are 3d8 Dust- men here, including the captain.

# 16 - Kitchen

The lower-ranking Dustmen rotate through this duty. The cooks work odd hours, rising long before dawn to start working on the next day's meal.

*Pots and pans hang overhead, and next meal is roasting in two large hearths. The kitchen is crowded and disorganized, but efficient. Six sweating men and women are preparing food and washing dishes. A haunch of meat sizzles over one fire, and a huge iron pot of stew bubbles over the other. One of the cooks catches sight of the party and says, "Dinner's not for three hours, berk. Get out of here before we report you.*
Unless the PCs are clearly a threat, the cooks ignore them and continue their work. At night this room is empty, and the hearths are cold.

# 17 - Common Room

This room is occasionally used as a meet- ing chamber. A couple of small tables with a dozen or so chairs are in the center of the room, and along one wall there are three kegs of cider. At the moment, the room is unoccupied, but there is a lot of traffic in this area.

# 18 - Dormitories

Each of these rooms is the temporary home of ld2O Dustmen. The smaller chambers belong to Id3 of middle rank, while the large chambers are open bunkrooms shared by Id 10 + 10 low-ranking Dustmen. During the day, most of these rooms are empty, but at night the residents re- turn for sleep.
Each Dustman is provided with a small bunk, a locked trunk, and a little closet space. The large bunkrooms are very spartan, and resemble military barracks. Generally, only Id6-1 (0 to 5) Dustmen are present during the day, but most everyone is sleeping here at night . Most in the large bunkrooms are standard Dustmen or Dustman guards.

# 19 - Toranna's Room

This chamber is almost identical to the other dormitories that surround it. Toranna is careful to keep any incriminating evidence in a different part of the building (Area 11, to be precise). She keeps odd hours and is often gone for most of the night.
A thorough search of her belongings reveals a holy sym- bol dedicated to Cyric, a pair of heavy keys (used to secure the crypt when she's not there), and a small pouch full of red glass beads. The beads are used to open the portal to the Ele- mental Plane of Fire. Her other belongings include several changes of clothing and a pair of earrings worth about 75 gp.

# 20 - Preparation Chambers

These large, open rooms are used to prepare bodies for interment. The various tools and chemicals of the embalmers fill the chambers.

*Iron chains hang from a track system in the stone ceiling, supporting cold steel slabs draped with sheets. Almost a dozen of the platforms are scattered through the room, several with bodies sprawled over them. Metal shelves with jugs of foul-smelling chemicals and rolls of white linen line the walls. Grisly tanks, pumps, and culling instruments are arranged by the bodies on the slabs. At the far end of the room an open balcony overlooks the central chamber.*
Although these two chambers are eerie and unsettling, there's nothing immediately hazardous or useful in either room. The embalm- ing chemicals are poisonous (type F if ingested), and a num- ber of instruments akin to daggers or knives can be found. The bodies are unremarkable.

# 21 - Embalmer's Chamber

This room is identical to the preparation chambers (Area 20) except that a group of Dustmen is at work here. Add the following description for this room.

*Every one of the iron slabs is occupied in this chamber, and several Dustmen are at work preparing the bodies. Six zombies stand by, occasionally moving bodies from platform to platform as ordered bv the embalmers. As you enter, the Dustmen look up iit surprise. "What are you doing here?" one demands.*

If the PCs enter this room during the Mortuary's open hours, the Dustmen are satisfied with any reasonable explanation. At night, they assume that the PCs are intruders and order them to surrender. If the PCs don't, the Dustmen attack after ordering the zombies to "Get them!"

# 22 - Receiving Room

This chamber is identical to the preparation rooms and embalmers' chamber, but is used for a differ- ent purpose. When bodies are first turned over to the Dustmen, they are sent here to be sorted and listed. This room is always busy, regardless of the time of day.

*Iron shelves line the walls of this room with sheet-covered bodies lying on them. Chain-supported platforms hang throughout the room, supporting more bodies. There arc at least two dozen in here. Several Dustmen are. checking over the bodies and writing out toe-tags. A huge, dusty volume sits on a desk in the room's center in which a scribe constantly makes entries. Zombies shamble back and forth, moving the bodies in and out as directed by the Dustmen.*

During the day, the Dustmen assume that the PCs have wandered away from their escorts and offer to show them back to the waiting area. At night, they assume that the PCs mean trouble, and order the zombies to catch them, while they send a someone for help. There are four Dustmen, a mage, and six zombies in this room.
There's nothing unusual about the bodies, but if the PCs examine the book they'll find that someone named Toranna signed for each barmy or bubber that was brought here, including Eliath and Tylaric.

# 23 - Interment Chambers

These rooms are very similar to the interment chambers described in Area 5. The chambers on this level generally lead to Upper or Lower Planes such as Elysium, the Gray Waste, the Beastlands, or Carceri. Refer to Area 5 for the unusual features that may be present in one of these chambers.

# 24 - Burial Party

No matter what time it is, the PCs encounter a burial party in this room. Six Dustmen are interring one of their own in a portal leading to Pandemonium.

*Gray curtains and iron sconces with yellow flames frame this chamber in leaping shadows. A body wrapped in tight black sheets lies on the platform, and six Dustmen stand around the deceased. As you enter, the Dustmen look up, and their eyes narrow in anger. "Who dares to disturb our ceremony?" growls one.*

The Dustmen attack any PCs who enter unless they can come up with an excellent explanation for their presence. There are five Dustmen and one priest here.

# 25 - Active Portal

When the PCs enter this room, they find one zombie standing before a portal leading to a graveyard in the Outland town of Plague-Mort. Unlike most in the Mortuary, this is a regular portal that opens with no key.

*This chamber is bare of any trappings except for an iron platform. A zombie stands motionless beside the slab, ignoring you. Suddenly, one of the blank stone arches glows with blue light. In a moment, a dim, crimson landscape appears inside. A town of dark stone with razorvine covering the building walls appears within the portal. A graveyard is in the foreground.*

The portal persists for two or three rounds, and then vanishes. The zombie is posted here to watch for portal open- ings and stop any non-Dustmen from entering the Mortuary from this doorway. The PCs can use this portal as an emergency escape from the Mortuary.

# 26 - Faction Armory

This room is protected by a door of heavy iron plate with two massive padlocks. The Dustmen store weaponry here in case they can't get to their main armories in the catacombs.
The armory is guarded by two monster skeletons similar to the skeletons in Area 6. They are under orders to attack any non-Dustmen who enter this room, but will not pursue any who flee the area.
The armory contains 30 spears, 25 short swords, 15 light crossbows with 15 cases of 20 bolts each, 4 suits of scale mail, 12 suits of ring mail, 8 shields, 4 helmets, and 4 long swords. In one corner there is a locked trunk guarded by a spring-loaded dart trap that attacks. The trunk contains a dagger +2, a long sword +1, six quarrels +2, a potion of healing, and a wand of magic missiles with 13 charges.

# 27 - Faction Council Chamber

The leaders of the Dustmen gather in this room for meetings. The room is customarily left open, but is not used very often.

*A table of dark mahogany dominates the center of this room. It is ringed bv chairs with high, arched backs. The walls are covered with dark paneling. On one wall hangs a massive copper symbol - the emblem of the Dustmen. One seat clearly must belong to the high-up man, since it's centered beneath the faction's symbol.*

On the underside of the table in front of this seat there is a light crossbow suspended from the table, loaded with a magical quarrel +2 smeared with Type E poison. The chair also has a secret lever that opens a trapdoor for someone to make a quick getaway to the hallway outside Area 13.
If the PCs linger here during the day, there is a 1 in 6 chance per turn that a group of Dustmen captains and mages will come in for a meeting of some kind. They won't take kindly to the presence of intruders here.

# 28 - Factol Secretary's Office

During the day, this room is open, and occupied by the factol's bodyguards and appointment secretary. At night, the door is locked securely and also wizard locked at the 12th-level of ability.

*This chamber is lavishly appointed with somber furnishings that remind one of a coffin. A desk sits in one corner and bookshelves line the walls. A studious man in the robes of a mage sits behind the desk, making notes in a journal. By the opposite door, two tough-looking warriors stand guard. They instantly challenge, "Whoever you are, you've come to the wrong place. Start explaining, and do it quick!"*

![[Komasahl and bodyguards.png|400]]

This is definitely trouble for the PCs. The two bodyguards are fighters at least three levels higher than the average party member, and the wizard is a fellow named Komosahl Trevant who is the second-ranking member of the Dustmen. All three are protected by powerful magic, such as stoneskin spells, and have magical weapons and armor. The party shouldn't win any fight here.
After one or two rounds, the factol and his personal guards from Area 29 come out to see what's happening on, and three rounds after that Dustmen start arriving at the rate of 2d4 per round to capture the intruders. If the PCs immediately knuckle under and offer a good excuse, they might walk away unscathed — Komosahl can be persuaded that the PCs are a group of mourners who took the wrong turn. He'll escort the PCs to the front door. 

# 29 - Factol's Office

Like the secretary's office, the factol's office is usually occupied during the daytime and empty at night. If the heroes somehow manage to break into this chamber, they'll find even more trouble than in the secretary's office.
The factol's office is exotically furnished with mementos and decorations from many planes and prime worlds. Secret safes conceal rare treasures, bookshelves contain a number of potions and scrolls, and several extremely valuable objects of art are scattered throughout the room.
The factol himself is a powerful lich named Skall,  who has run the Dustmen for several hundred years using various illusions to present different faces to different people. He's attended by two elite bodyguards. Skall is powerful enough to kill or capture the PCs without breaking a sweat. If the PCs do fall into his hands, he will drag the truth of what's happening out of them and then send them into the plane of Fire as cannon fodder to put a stop to Veylith's plans.
By night, all entrances to this chamber are guarded by symbols of fear. A squad of six juju zombies make sure that none of the factol's belongings are tampered with when he's not here. One of the interesting features of the room is the eastern closet, which is a portal leading directly to the citadel of the Dustmen on the Negative Energy Plane.

# 30 - The Overvault

This low chamber sits directly beneath the dome. Portals leading to the various Elemental Planes can be found in the small galleries that surround this chamber. The area is only lightly trafficked.

*The upper level of the Mortuary's dome is one expansive chamber, divided by the vaulting that supports the roof. Narrow galleries run around the perimeter of the room, with dark portals gaping. Chains suspended from the ceiling support a number of iron platforms similar to those in the chambers below. Several sheet-draped bodies await interment, and several zombies shamble about the room, moving the bodies or greasing the chain tracks. From one corner a brilliant reddish light dances beneath the roof. Two Dustmen are standing before a portal filled with raging flame. They seem about to slide a body through the portal.*

![[the overvault.png|500]]

If the PCs have not met Toranna yet, or have no real idea of what's going on, they encounter her at her work. Toranna and her assistant are interring the body of a barmy that was just received. Of course, the barmy isn't really dead — he's been affected by a feign death spell, and Toranna is sending him to the Citadel of Fire.
When Toranna sees the PCs, she orders the nearest zombies (there are four of them) to attack, and sends her assistant for help. The assistant returns in six rounds with the squad of Dustmen from Area 12. In the meantime, Toranna fights a delaying action.
Toranna has a pouch on her belt with dozens of red glass beads in it, the key used to open the portal to the Elemental Plane of Fire. The portal is open when the PCs arrive, so they can go through it if they move quickly.
If Toranna is captured, she resists questioning. If she is charmed, she can give the party most of the details of the Eternal Boundary plan. She knows that the Shadowknave is working in the Hive to find barmies to send to her, and she knows that the bodies she receives are not incinerated but instead picked up at the Citadel. She suspects that Veylith has some use for them, but doesn't know that they're being returned to the city of Sigil.
