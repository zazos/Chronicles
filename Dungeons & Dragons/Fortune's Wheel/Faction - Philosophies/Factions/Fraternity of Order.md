*Who Discover Laws to Find Truth*

![[FactionFraternityofOrder5e.webp | 300]]

**Factol**: Hashkar

**Headquarters**: High Courts

**Aligned Plane**: Mechanus

**Members**: Con artists, lawyers, spellcasters

**Epithet**: Guvners

The Fraternity of Order examines existence through the lens of three tenets: laws are representations of power, knowledge is power, and knowledge of law is the ultimate power. By understanding those laws, individuals can exploit them—or break them under the right circumstances.

According to the Guvners, there are three types of regulations. The lowest of these are **Rules**, the laws that govern people’s behavior. Next come **Laws**, such as the laws of nature or the edicts of gods. Ultimate authority descends from **Axioms**, overarching laws that govern existence and give gods their immense power. Guvners theorize about Axioms but know few of them. A being who masters all Axioms can rule the multiverse.

Factol Hashkar (lawful neutral, dwarf Fraternity of Order law bender) is the highest authority in Sigil’s court system, though he casts verdicts in only the most important cases. Hashkar is as long winded as he is knowledgeable, and any inquiry sparks an impromptu lecture. Outside legal matters, the factol splits his time between learning and lecturing. He has mastered at least one Axiom, from which he derives his magical abilities.

**Faction Attire**. Guvners wear distinctive tall hats and matching robes. They are often accompanied by small attendants—mephits, imps, and homunculi who carry their tomes of order.

**Role in Sigil**. The Fraternity of Order reviews, studies, and adjudicates the laws of Sigil, all the while searching for hidden truths that dictate reality. Guvners gather detailed records of every portal and key they find in Sigil and pay well for such information. Unsurprisingly, the Guvners are staunch allies of the Harmonium and Mercykillers and bitterly oppose the Hands of Havoc.

## One Good Law Deserves Another

For the Guvners, Sigil’s lawmaking faction, there could never be enough rules. Laws, they reckon, give a body structure in life, telling them what they can, can’t, shouldn’t and should do in any given situation. They remove the problematic tasks of decision-making and moral quandaries. “If everyone followed Our Laws,” they say, “the Multiverse would run smooth and sweet.”

It ain’t all blind obedience and compulsion, though. See, if a cutter figures out the natural Laws of the Multiverse too, then he’ll not only understand how to follow them better, but he’ll also know what loopholes exist. Some Guvners have discovered and exploited these loopholes, granting them strange and useful powers, like magic, but not. One factor’s reportedly able to open his own portals, another can slip into the **Astral** Plane at will…

‘Course, all this provokes howls of laughter from **Xaositects** who’re watching closely. “The Guvners only study Laws so they know how to break them!” they shout. Fraternity factioneers are quick, perhaps too quick, to deny this, of course — that would be bad publicity…
