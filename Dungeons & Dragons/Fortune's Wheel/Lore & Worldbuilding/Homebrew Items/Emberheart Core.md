*Wondrous Item, Artifact (requires attunement)*

![[Emberheart Core.webp|200]]

A shard of primordial flame encased within a core of obsidian and brass, the Emberheart Core pulses with a slow, smoldering light, its heat tangible even at a distance.

## Current Status: Contained

The Emberheart Core is currently housed within a **specialized obsidian slab containment system** discovered in the Citadel of the Elemental Plane of Fire. This ancient containment device functions as a **permanent anti-magic field** specifically designed to suppress the core's thermal and nuclear energies, preventing catastrophic release while allowing study and transport.

**Containment Properties:**
- Creates a localized anti-magic field that suppresses the core's active abilities
- Prevents the core's heat signature from being detected beyond 5 feet
- Requires no attunement while contained - abilities are completely dormant
- Obsidian slab weighs 50 lbs and is roughly 2 feet square, 3 inches thick
- Opening the containment requires a successful DC 20 Arcana check and takes 1 minute
- Closing containment is automatic when the core is placed back inside

**Ignition Veins**: While attuned to this artifact, your **blood runs with latent heat**, manifesting in the following ways:

- You **resist fire damage** and **ignore extreme heat** conditions.
- Your weapon attacks and spells **ignore fire resistance** (but not immunity).
- When you score a **critical hit with a melee weapon or a spell attack**, the target takes an **additional 1d8 fire damage**.

**Scorched Awakening**: Once per long rest, when you are reduced to **0 HP**, the Emberheart Core **shatters outward in a violent eruption** before reforming, pulling you back from the brink of death:

- You immediately regain **half your maximum HP** and **stand up as a free action**.
- Every creature within **10 feet** of you must make a **DC 15 Dexterity saving throw** or take **4d8 fire damage**, half on success.
- Any non-magical flammable object in the area **bursts into flames**.


## Class-Specific Attunement Abilities

When attuned, the Emberheart Core resonates differently with each wielder's magical essence, unlocking abilities tailored to their class:

### **1. Emberforged Mechanisms (Artificer)**

Your magical creations become infused with elemental fire:

- Your **Steel Defender, Homunculus, or Turrets** gain **fire immunity** and their attacks **deal an additional 1d6 fire damage**.
- **Infusions** you create can be **overcharged once per long rest**: choose one infused item to gain an additional property for 24 hours (DM determines the fire-themed enhancement).
- **Spell-Storing Items** you create can store one additional spell, and when that spell is cast, it **deals maximum fire damage** instead of rolling.

### **2. Harmonious Inferno (Bard)**

Your magic weaves fire into song and story:

- **Bardic Inspiration** can be used to grant an ally **fire resistance** until the end of their next turn (no action required).
- When you cast a **spell that targets multiple creatures**, you can choose to have it **ignore fire resistance** and deal an **additional 1d4 fire damage per spell level**.
- **Magical Secrets** gained from this attunement allow you to learn one **Evocation or Transmutation spell** from any class list (must involve fire or heat).

### **3. Moonfire Baptism (Druid)**

For Druids, this artifact **redefines the nature of their Wild Shape**:

- Your beast form **gains fire immunity** and attacks **deal an additional 1d8 fire damage**.
- While **Wild Shaped**, you can cast **Produce Flame** and **Faerie Fire** without expending spell slots.
- Once per short rest, when you **drop to 0 HP in Wild Shape**, you **explode in phoenix fire**, forcing enemies within 15 feet to make a **Dexterity save (DC 15)** or take **4d8 fire damage**, half on success. You then revert to human form with 1 HP.

### **4. Crimson Hunter's Mark (Blood Hunter)**

The core amplifies your blood magic with primal fire:

- Your **Crimson Rite** damage type can be changed to **fire damage**, and the rite **deals an additional 1d4 damage**.
- **Blood Curses** can be **amplified with fire**: spend an additional Hit Point when using a Blood Curse to have it **deal 1d6 fire damage** to the target.
- Once per long rest, when you use **Blood Maledict**, all enemies within 30 feet of your target must make a **Constitution save (DC 8 + proficiency + Wisdom modifier)** or take **2d8 fire damage** and be **frightened** until the end of their next turn.

### **5. Emberforged Pact (Warlock)**

Your patron's power mingles with primordial flame:

- **Eldritch Invocations** you know can be **supercharged once per long rest**: choose one invocation to gain an enhanced effect with a fire theme for 10 minutes (DM discretion).
- Your **Pact Weapon** (if Pact of the Blade) becomes wreathed in flames, dealing an **additional 1d8 fire damage** and shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius.
- **Pact of the Chain familiars** gain **fire resistance**, **1d6 additional fire damage** on attacks, and **explode for 3d6 fire damage** in a 10-foot radius when reduced to 0 HP (once per long rest).

### **6. Universal Ability: Smoldering Surge**

*Available to all classes as a bonus action:*

You gain the following benefits for **1 minute**:
- **Movement speed increases by 15 feet**
- **Weapon and spell attacks deal an additional 1d6 fire damage**
- When you take damage, **fire erupts from your form**, dealing **1d6 fire damage** to all creatures within **5 feet**

Once this ability ends, you suffer **one level of exhaustion** unless you are in **direct sunlight, an active fire source, or have taken fire damage** in the last minute.


### **Cursed Ember (Optional DM Activation)**

If the **core is removed from the Plane of Fire for too long**, it begins to **slowly consume its wielder**:

- After **30 days**, the user must make a **DC 14 Constitution saving throw** at dawn each day. On a failure, their **maximum HP is reduced by 1d6** as the Emberheart **feeds on their vitality**. This effect lasts until the artifact is **brought back to extreme heat (such as lava or a forge of elemental origin)**.
- If the user dies while holding the Core, their **body burns to ash**, and their **soul lingers as a burning wraith**, bound to the Plane of Fire unless resurrected.

## DM EYES ONLY: PROGRESSION PATH

### The Quest to Harness the Core

Based on intelligence gathered from **[[Shafi Bin Ahmad Zin|Shafi Bin Ahmad Zin]]**, the party has learned that properly utilizing the Emberheart Core requires three specialized components to create a **biological integration system** that would allow safe implantation and control:

#### Required Components:

**1. Infernal Iron Clasp**
- **Purpose:** A hinge mechanism that can withstand the core's heat without melting
- **Source Options:**
  - Purchase from Shafi's broker in Sigil (costly - requires trading in "promise" and "principle")
  - Harvest from fallen Hellknight armor on the banks of the River Styx
  - Salvage from Blood War battlefields in Dis
  - Forge-crafted infernal iron from the foundries of Dis
- **Mechanical Effect:** Provides structural integrity for implantation

**2. Flesh-Affinity Thread**
- **Purpose:** Bio-compatible threading that bonds with living tissue without rejection
- **Source Options:**
  - Sinew from fire-spiders in Ysgard's burning fields
  - Glands from phase-thread parasites in Carceri (requires "gloves woven from lies")
- **Mechanical Effect:** Allows the core to interface with the host's circulatory and nervous systems
- **Note:** Shafi can help process this component once obtained

**3. Soul-Carving Scalpel** ⚠️ **DANGEROUS PATH**
- **Purpose:** A surgical tool capable of "cutting truth from flesh" to create the implantation socket
- **Source:** The unnamed collective beneath Sigil's Skin Market / [[The Church of Experiments]]
- **Warning:** These "graft-thieves" and "flesh-hackers" may not stop at creating just the socket
- **Risk:** Once they begin surgery, they may attempt additional "modifications"

### Implementation Stages:

**Stage 1: Component Gathering** (Current)
- Party must choose which sources to pursue for each component
- Each source involves different risks, costs, and moral implications

**Stage 2: Integration Preparation**
- Find a trustworthy surgeon or learn to perform the procedure themselves
- Alternatively, risk dealing with the underground collective

**Stage 3: Biological Integration**
- Surgical implantation of the core with gathered components
- **Success:** Core becomes part of the host's body, abilities permanently active but controllable
- **Failure:** Could result in death, corruption, or unwanted modifications

### Enhanced Abilities (Post-Integration):

If successfully integrated, the core would grant:
- All current abilities become always-active (no attunement required)
- **Thermal Regulation:** Immune to fire damage, resistance to cold
- **Core Overcharge:** Once per long rest, can supercharge abilities for 10 minutes (double all fire damage, extended ranges)
- **Phoenix Rebirth:** The "Scorched Awakening" ability gains additional uses and enhanced effects
- **Risk:** Integration makes removal impossible without killing the host

### Alternative Paths:

**Artifice Route:** Work with skilled artificers to create an external harness or focus item instead of biological integration
**Planar Route:** Seek guidance from fire elementals or efreet who might know ancient techniques
**Divine Route:** Petition fire-aligned deities for safe integration methods
