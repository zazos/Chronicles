# Psionic Imbued Longsword 
#### *Weapon (longsword), rare (requires attunement by a create with psionic abilities)*  

| ![[Psionic Imbued Longsword.webp\|300]] | *Shimmering, viridian-pink flames engulf the sword when channeled with psionic energies. Though once attuned to the Astral flows of Shra’kt’lor, Mindpiercer has adapted—capable of channeling raw mental force through any hand strong enough to grasp its purpose. |

## **Effects & Abilities**  

- This sword deals either slashing or psychic damage—your choice when you hit.
- You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

### **[Enhanced Psionic Properties]** *(Unlocked if the attuned creature is psionic, or has Intelligence >= 16)*  
- **Psionic Lash**. When you hit with Mindpiercer, you deal an additional 1d8 psychic damage. If the target is concentrating, it rolls concentration saves with disadvantage. You can only use this feature if you are **not concentrating** on a spell or ability. If you are, using it ends your concentration immediately.
- **Mental Feedback (1/long rest)**. When targeted by a psychic, illusion, or enchantment effect, you may use your reaction to lash out. The caster must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw (DC 15) or take 4d6 psychic damage and be stunned until the end of its next turn.
- **Astral Insight.** You gain advantage on Arcana and Insight checks related to the Astral Plane, psionics, or dream-state effects.
