# **A Day in the Life of a Cager** — **Jaimi Bimkz**

_Jaimi Bimkz is a human seamstress, lives in the Lower Ward, and is a namer in the Free League. This is her story._

#### **Prologue. An hour before antipeak**

Well, out with the formalities first of all then. I’m Jaimi Bimkz, and I’m the best bleaking seamstress in Sigil. The nine stingers I’m getting for my entry on this mimir is about how I live. That said, I’ll be recording tomorrow… I’m off to sleep.

Woken by the sound of that flock of Astral Streakers that passes every morning about this time, I get up out of bed and wash my face with the water in my basin. I’ve been using the same water for 3 weeks… I use it more to wake myself up than to get clean. Well, while I’m on the subject, I suppose I’ll tell you berks about my kip.

She’s a little second floor kip in an apartment building that sits next to Bleaker housing project. The old girl has three sparse, dirty little rooms, including my bedroom and bathroom. I like to be at my shop more’n home, it’s nice there. Home is dirty. I haven’t got much in my place ‘cept for the basin, a mirror, my bed, a cabinet where I keep dishes (in case company comes calling… hah), a table with a stool in case I eat at home, and a wardrobe, with my three shirts and two skirts. There’s a crack [in the wall, covered by the mirror, and I’m happy I’m only on the second floor lest the ceiling would drip on me. The building itself is a dull, gray, plaster building… like so many others around here.

Well, as I was saying, I’ve just woken up and I need to dress. I put on a burgundy patched up skirt that’s down to my ankles, a grey shirt, and my long grey jacket. I pull my hair back and knot it there, so it doesn’t get in the way of my work. I’ll be going out for a bite to eat now… it’s tough to work on an empty stomach. I probably won’t be back home until much later tonight, as I work in the Market Ward and it’s quite a trek.


#### **Five and a half hours after antipeak**

I’m at the **Ubiquitous Wayfarer** on the edge of the Lower and Clerks Ward, regardless of whatever berks say it’s in the Lady’s. It’s a quant little place that serves primes and planars alike, especially folks that just tripped in from some portal… the kip’s loaded with the sodding things. The place serves up a nice bowl of good, affordable porridge… and doubles as a good place to find new people.

Take that tief over there. She’s wearing last month’s fashion… the shoulder blades, dark cape, leather, crazy black-died hair. She needs something new, and she looks like she has some jink to drop…

“Yes ma’am, I’m talkin’ about you and your shoulder blades. You need to do something about that, where are you coming from, Baator?”

“What’s this insolence? I’m on my way to the Hall of Speakers.”

“Not dressed like that I hope. You need something more colourful, all that grey… people won’t pay attention to you if you’re dressed in only grey and black.”

“I’m a **[Knight of Entropy](https://mimir.net/cutters/the-knights-of-decay/)**, now sod off. This is my military uniform.”

Ahh, well, you can’t win ’em all. Enough of here for now then, time to keep walking. My morning routine revolves around my getting to the Market in time, and it takes 2 hours to walk… even in the morning’s light traffic.
