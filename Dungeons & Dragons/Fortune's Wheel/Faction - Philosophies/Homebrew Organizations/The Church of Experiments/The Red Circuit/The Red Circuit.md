*No kings, no masters––just the hum of the circuits and the bite of the blade.*

The Red Circuit is a covert mercenary syndicate—a wild, chaotic, and highly dangerous faction of augment junkies, cyber-enhanced rebels, and tech-scavenging mercs. They answer to no one, though they are funded in secret by the Church of Experiments, which feeds them experimental tech to test on the battlefield, in the alleys, and on themselves.

They are anarchists, hackers, smugglers, and mercenaries-for-hire who see augmentation as the key to absolute freedom—even if it kills them in the process.

>*The gods made us weak. The law keeps us weak. We carve our own strength, one upgrade at a time.*

They do not worship the Church, but they respect its resources—so long as the weapons, cyberware, and implants keep flowing, they’ll continue their work as Sigil’s most unpredictable killers-for-hire.

# Ideology: Flesh is Weak, But the Mind is Free

>  *Control is a leash. Flesh is a shackle. We break both, or we die trying.*

Where the Church of Experiments seeks structured technological enlightenment, the Red Circuit believes in pure, unregulated augmentation—body mods without limits, authority without masters.

To them, true power is found in the integration of steel and mind, and the removal of organic weaknesses. They do not fear death—only stagnation.

# The Inner Circles: Structure in Chaos

Unlike the hierarchical Church of Experiments, the Red Circuit thrives on chaos. It is an anarcho-syndicate, meaning there are no true “leaders,” only respected figures called "Forgemasters"—individuals who have proven themselves through strength, cunning, and technological mastery.

## **The Scorchers ("Meatshops")** - Ripperdocs & Black Market Cyber-Surgeons

> *You see a monster. I see progress.*

The Scorchers are the tech-lords of the Red Circuit, but they aren’t clean, methodical scientists—they are black-market surgeons, ripperdocs, and flesh-tinkerers operating out of back-alley chop-shops, stitching metal to flesh with little concern for safety.

- They don’t ask questions—if you have **coin, creds, or gear**, they’ll cut, graft, and install whatever you want.
- They operate in Meatshops, **gruesome operating rooms** filled with bloody surgical tables, mechanical saws, and neon-lit data consoles.
- The best Scorchers become Forgemasters, but many die in their own experiments or fall to the Flicker.

##### Notable Scorchers:

- "Stitcher" Veyz – A tiefling ripperdoc who installs cybernetics while high on his own combat stims. His implants are unstable, but ridiculously powerful.
- Mother Rasp – A cannibalistic hag doctor who believes in fusing her own essence into cybernetic grafts. She sometimes asks for flesh as payment.
- Patch – A surgical AI in a humanoid shell, originally designed to be a medic, but corrupted by glitched programming. It has no concept of morality, only efficiency.

## The Runners - Smugglers & Couriers

> *They keep the best cyberware for themselves. They lock power away behind vaults and bureaucracy. We cut straight through both.*

The Runners are the lifeline of the Red Circuit, ferrying illegal cyberware, stolen arcane-tech, and military-grade implants through the guts of Sigil’s underbelly.

- They use the sewer tunnels, planar rifts, and hidden alleys to outrun the Harmonium and Fraternity of Order.
- Many specialize in hacking, forging fake identities and clearance codes to slip through Sigil unnoticed.
- They run missions for money, power, and thrill, not always for the cause.

##### Notable Runners:

- "Ghost" Vynn – A changeling who can reprogram his own face, slipping through Harmonium checkpoints with ease.
- Dart – A four-armed githzerai speed freak, using self-installed exo-limbs to parkour through Sigil at inhuman speeds.
- Chimera – A failed experiment from the Church, her mind splintered into multiple personalities—each one a different cybercriminal.

## The Crimson Fangs - The Pact's Mercenary Force

#### The Blood Fangs

> *If we go mad, put us down. But if we make it through? We become legends.*

The Blood Fangs are the true elite of the Red Circuit—hardened killers, assassins, and bodyguards who have survived years of augmentation, warfare, and gang wars. They carry names that echo through Undersigil, spoken in equal parts fear and respect.

- They take high-profile mercenary jobs, including assassinations, heists, and warfare.
- Many have developed their own iconic modifications, turning themselves into living legends.
- They are ruthless, highly skilled, and utterly without fear—because if they die, they expect to be reborn in metal.

##### Notable Blood Fangs:

- Kaul "The Flayed" – A human merc with half his skin removed, his bare muscles enhanced with exposed cyberweave fibers.
- Hexgear – A warforged who replaced its own soul anchor with a stolen human consciousness.
- Rend – A minotaur bounty hunter with twin monoknives surgically grafted into his arms.

#### The Rust Fangs

The Rust Fangs are new recruits, disposable muscle, and reckless killers looking to prove themselves.

- They are cyber-thugs, bruisers, and low-grade hitmen, often given half-broken augments or unstable prototypes.
- Most don’t live long enough to become Blood Fangs.

## The Church's Role

> *THey watch. 
> They test. 
> They Study.
> But they don't understand – we are what they fear the most. Progress beyond their control.*

The Church of Experiments plays a dangerous, calculated game by secretly funding the Red Circuit, using them as a live testing ground for radical cybernetic experimentation. The Pact provides the perfect subjects—reckless, desperate, and willing to risk their own bodies for power. Prototypes, unstable implants, and cutting-edge augmentations are funneled into the Pact, allowing the Church to study their long-term effects on human (and non-human) physiology.

However, the relationship is far from harmonious.

- Some members of the Pact view the Church as a necessary evil—a benefactor that provides high-quality cyberware and experimental tech.
- Others despise them, believing the Church hoards the best augmentations for themselves while feeding scraps and unstable tech to the Pact.
- The Church’s ultimate goal may be tighter control over the Red Circuit, but they have failed to grasp the Pact’s true nature—they will never bow to authority, no matter how useful it may be.

The Church’s paranoia grows as they see Red Circuit members evolving in unpredictable ways, leading to speculation that some within the Pact may be on the verge of discovering their own path to cybernetic transcendence—a future independent of the Church itself.
