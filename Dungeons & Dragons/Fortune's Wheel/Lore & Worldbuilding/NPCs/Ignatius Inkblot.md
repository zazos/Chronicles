### His introduction in the Casino
Ignatius Inkblot, the enigmatic mind flayer detective, makes his entrance in the heart of Fortune’s Wheel—perhaps at the **Dragon Bar** or among the velvet-lined tables of the casino proper. He stands out: impeccably dressed in a tailored coat, his tentacles neatly groomed, and a detective’s notebook in hand. He surveys the crowd with a keen, analytical gaze, occasionally jotting cryptic notes or sketching diagrams in his book.

- **Atmosphere:** The air around him is tinged with the faint scent of ink and ozone. He is polite but distant, his psionic presence felt by those sensitive to such things.
    
- **First Impression:** He might be seen quietly questioning a croupier, observing the security nothics, or watching the illusory fountain with professional interest.

Ignatius is not here to gamble—he’s on a case. His investigation centers on the **Stranger** being transported via the Concordant Express, and he suspects a connection to Shemeshka, the casino’s cunning owner.

- **Connecting the Dots:** Rumors suggest Shemeshka has taken an interest in the Stranger, or perhaps intends to infiltrate the train herself. Ignatius is gathering intelligence, watching for signs of her agents or unusual activity among the casino’s guests.

## Tone and Approach

Ignatius speaks with precision and restraint. He avoids embellishment, focusing on facts and observations. When questioned about his mind flayer heritage, he is matter-of-fact, neither defensive nor apologetic, and steers the conversation back to the investigation whenever possible.

### On the Casino and Shemeshka

> Shemeshka’s reputation precedes her. I prefer to rely on evidence, not rumor.
> I observe. I record. I draw conclusions. The rest is noise.


### On the Stranger and the Concordant Express

> There’s movement beneath the surface—someone is invested in this transfer. I intend to find out who.

### On Working with the Party

> I will assist against Shemeshka's machinations. Her methods are crude and dangerous.
    
> However, if you intend to unleash that prisoner's knowledge upon the planes... we have a problem.
    
> Some secrets exist in chains for good reason. Do not mistake liberation for wisdom.

### On Dangerous Knowledge

> **"Knowledge such as this should be confined, not freed. There are truths that burn through minds like acid through flesh."**
    
> **"You think yourselves liberators, but you would unleash forces beyond your comprehension. Step aside—let higher beings than us decide his fate."**


### Addressing His Mind Flayer Nature

> I am what I am. The past is a matter of record, not sentiment.
    
> Colony life is efficient, but limiting. I found independence preferable.
    
> I don’t miss the collective. Thought is clearer without the noise.
    

> Leaving was a matter of necessity, not choice. The details are unimportant.
    
> Some colonies tolerate deviation. Mine did not.


## Combat Philosophy

**Non-Lethal Preference:** Ignatius avoids killing, preferring to:
- Incapacitate with *suggestion* or *dominate person*
- Use *modify memory* to make opponents forget dangerous information
- Employ *counterspell* and *dispel magic* to neutralize threats
- Restrain with tentacles rather than brain extraction

**Escalation Protocol:**
1. **Verbal Warning:** Appeals to reason and responsibility
2. **Mental Probing:** Uses *detect thoughts* and Detective's Probe
3. **Non-Lethal Control:** *Suggestion*, *dominate person*, tentacle grappling
4. **Lethal Force:** Only if innocents are directly threatened

## Equipment

**Professional Gear:**
- Detective's notebook (magically encrypted)
- Writing implements (focus for spellcasting)
- Formal investigator's clothing (+1 AC bonus, counts as natural armor)
- Badge of office (provides authority in legal situations)
- Evidence collection kit
- Emergency communication crystals
