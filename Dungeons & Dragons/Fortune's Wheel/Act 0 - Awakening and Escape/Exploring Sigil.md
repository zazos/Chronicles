## A Tout to Help You Out

After leaving the Mortuary, the characters emerge in Ragpicker’s Square in the Hive Ward. There they meet their first local, an irritable tiefling commoner with devilish hooves who bumps into them in the street. Flustered and clearly in the wrong, the tiefling spins around and berates the characters

*“Take a short stick and pike it, you leather-headed berk, or I’ll put your name in the dead-book! I swear, more and more of you clueless wind up in the Cage every day. Quit flapping your bone boxes, and go back to your own burgs.”*

The tetchy pedestrian might be either a planar wanderer spouting nonsense or a Sigil resident embellishing their speech with local slang. Before the exchange can escalate, a spunky bariaur wanderer (see Morte’s Planar Parade) named Parisa intervenes and tells the tiefling to scram; the commoner continues along their way with a sneer. 

Parisa scrapes a living in Sigil as a tout, a guide to the City of Doors. Brazen, street savvy, and a little mischievous, the bariaur knows all the local hot spots and the portals that lead to them. She offers her services to the party for just 3 gp per day. If they refuse, the characters can explore the city on their own or nd another guide. Alternatively, you can have Parisa reappear later in this chapter.

*«“It’s daunting, isn’t it? The sudden feeling that everything and everywhere are now at your fingertips. Don’t worry; I won’t lead you astray. Where do you want to go first?”»*


## Exploring Sigil

Chapter 2 of Sigil and the Outlands describes life in Sigil and the locations on the poster map. Use this information, along with the random encounter table in each ward’s section, to bring the multiversal hub to life. Sigil is a metropolis with manifold attractions; feel free to add in adventuring sites of your own creation. How long the characters spend in the City of Doors is up to you, but they should have enough time to take a long rest before the Harmonium spoils the fun (see the “Sigil Encounters” section).

## Sights and Wonders

Parisa or any other unocial guide can recommend the following activities to the characters:

**Eat Planar Grub.** From the eclectic street foods of the Grease Pit to the posh cuisine of the Gastrognome, Sigil offers a taste of the multiverse. 

**Get Ink at Fell’s Tattoos.** A dabus (see Morte’s Planar Parade) named Fell runs a tattoo parlor in the Hive Ward. For 10 gp, Fell can give a character a magic tattoo that functions as a nexus feature (see “Glitch Characters” in the introduction). He can later remove it for the same amount. 

**Rest at the Ubiquitous Wayfarer.** Accessible via dozens of planar portals, the Ubiquitous Wayfarer is a friendly, three-story tavern in the Lower Ward. Its proprietor, Riaen Blackhome, rents rooms for 2 gp per night. 

**Say a Planar Prayer.** No power is too obscure to worship in the Lady’s Ward, where demonic cultists and goodly priests erect temples side by side. 

**Send a Squeak.** A guide introduces the characters to the pervasive rodents called cranium rat squeakers (see Morte’s Planar Parade) and explains how to communicate using them. 

**Shop at the Great Bazaar.** Anything and everything is sold in the bustling avenues of the Great Bazaar: equipment, food and drink, even magic items. 

**Visit a Faction’s Headquarters.** Sigil is home to twelve ascendant factions, which perform important city functions. Some are friendlier than others, but characters who have the Planar Philosopher background and their comrades enjoy easy access to their factions’ headquarters and amenities.
