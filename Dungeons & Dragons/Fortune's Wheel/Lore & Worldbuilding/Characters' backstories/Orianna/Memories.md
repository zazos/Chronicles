In the dimly lit, dank chamber, Orianna was shackled to a cold, stone table. The cult's members surrounded her, their twisted faces leering at her, as she fought to keep her composure. Her tormentors had subjected her to relentless physical and psychological abuse, searching for the source of her latent powers. Desperation filled her heart, and in moments of profound vulnerability, she began to pray to any entity that might listen. She prayed for a long time, but nobody really answered. Her cagers and tormentors bullied her about praying to "good" aligned deities, as if they could do anything to save this wretched and disgusting creature. 
One day though,

Orianna: (whispering, her voice quivering) "Please, anyone who can hear me, if you're out there, if you can help, I beg you. I can't endure this pain any longer. I'll give anything for the strength to escape this torment."

As she spoke these words, a distant female voice echoed in her mind, both soothing and ominous. It carried an unmistakable air of authority.

Mysterious Entity: (whispering, seductive) "I hear your plea, child of suffering. You seek power, and power is what I can offer. But be warned, such gifts come at a price. What are you willing to give in return?"

Orianna: (desperation in her voice) "Anything, I said. I'll give anything to be free and to stop this... this madness."

A female figure, both alluring and terrifying, materializes before Orianna. She stands with a commanding presence, her form exuding an aura of dark authority. Her body is clad in sleek, obsidian armor that melds seamlessly with her dark, ashen skin, accentuating her powerful and graceful silhouette.

Crimson wings, like those of a fallen angel, unfurl from her back, and they seem to pulse with malevolent energy. Her eyes, two blazing orbs of fiery intensity, fixate upon Orianna with an unwavering gaze that seems to pierce through the very soul.

Long, midnight-black hair cascades down her shoulders, adorned with sinister, blood-red highlights. A silver diadem, encrusted with infernal runes, graces her brow, its glow casting eerie shadows across her striking features.

Her armor is embellished with barbed motifs and sinister, serpentine engravings that writhe and undulate as if alive. In her hand, she holds a wickedly curved blade, its blade a glimmering edge of cold, merciless steel.

As she speaks the terms of the contract, her voice is a hypnotic and commanding melody, laced with seductive undertones and an undertone of vengeful authority. Her presence is overwhelming as the room seemed to grow even colder as the entity's presence became more palpable. The cultists noticed the change in the atmosphere and hesitated, fear in their eyes.

Mysterious Entity: (unfolding its terms) "Then it is agreed. You shall have the power you desire, the infernal magic that courses through your veins. Crush your oppressors and bring them to justice. Remember and revere my name little one, Valyndra, the Scourge of Souls. And do not forget, Orianna. With power comes responsibility. You are bound to me now, and I shall call upon you when the time is right. You will do my bidding, for our fates are now intertwined."

Orianna: (with determination) "I understand. I'll do whatever it takes to escape this nightmare and to protect others from suffering like I have."

The room trembled as the entity's presence intensified, and a surge of dark energy engulfed Orianna. Her tormentors watched in terror as her eyes turned black, her hair aflame, and her nails grew into sharp claws.

With newfound power coursing through her veins, Orianna's restraints shattered, and she stood, transformed. The cultists fled in terror, leaving her alone in the room, her body infused with infernal magic.

Orianna: (whispering to herself) "I will use this power for good. I'll protect those who can't protect themselves."

In that moment, Orianna's pact with the mysterious entity was sealed, granting her the infernal powers she needed to escape her captors and embark on her path to protect the weak and confront her tumultuous destiny.


As Orianna returned to her village, her heart sank when she saw nothing but ashes where her home once stood. The memories of her parents and the life they once had were reduced to smoldering ruins. Grief and anger welled up within her, but amidst the desolation, a small, impish figure materialized in the smoke and haze.

Orianna: (in disbelief) "Who... who are you?"

The imp, a mischievous grin on its face, fluttered closer and introduced itself.

Blib: "I'm Blib, you impotent doofus, sent by our mutual acquaintance. I am here to keep an eye to you, don't make anything stupid etcetera, you know the drill. Ah, also, I'm here to assist you on your journey. Now, lets make people suffer hehe."

Orianna's initial fear and confusion gave way to a sense of understanding. She realized that Blib was her link to the entity who granted her infernal powers. With a hesitant nod, she accepted Blib's presence.

Orianna: "Thank you, Blib. I'm not sure what lies ahead, but I'm determined to use the power I've been given for good."

Blib: (cheerful) "Good, because our master has plans for you. Together, we shall walk a path of both shadows and light. I'll be here to guide you, and when the time comes, I'll be the voice that delivers our master's wishes. Wait, did you just say "use the power i've been given FOR GOOD"? Hells ... you have much to learn my infernal cake."

With Blib at her side, Orianna had a newfound sense of purpose. While the imp's presence was a constant reminder of the enigmatic entity's influence, it also offered her the guidance and support she needed to navigate her tumultuous destiny. Blib would prove to be an invaluable companion, helping Orianna understand the depths of her powers and the responsibilities that came with them.



**Name of the Erinyes:** [[Valyndra.webp||Valyndra]].




The chamber was a nightmarish room of swirling shadows and jagged obsidian. Chains, wrought from malevolence itself, ensnared Valyndra, her crimson wings bound and her ethereal presence diminished. She looked upon Orianna with eyes that burned like smoldering coals.

Valyndra's voice dripped with both seductive charm and imperious authority as she demanded, "You, Orianna, release me now! You are bound to me by the pact you willingly forged. You shall obey my every rule and command, or your soul shall be forfeit, and you shall know eternal torment."

Orianna, weary of a lifetime spent pursuing vengeance and retribution, found her resolve waver. In a moment of defiance, she uttered, "Ah fuck you, so be it."

As Valyndra held Orianna in her imperious gaze, the chamber trembled with dark energy and the air grew heavy with a presence far more powerful than her. A voice, resonating with an authority that dwarfed even the Erinyes, whispered softly but with overwhelming force, "Orianna, you seek freedom, and I shall provide it."

Valyndra's crimson eyes widened in astonishment. "M-master?" she exclaimed, her voice quivering with a mix of disbelief and trepidation.

He appeared as a tall, imposing figure, his form wreathed in shadows that danced like living ink. His eyes, like orbs of polished onyx, held an inscrutable depth of knowledge and cunning.
Crimson robes, adorned with intricate patterns of silver and gold, draped around his lithe frame, rustling with an air of unspoken authority. His fingers were long and slender, each one adorned with ornate rings that seemed to pulse with arcane energy.
A silver diadem, studded with onyx gems, graced his brow, its presence marking him as a ruler of infernal dominions. His raven-black hair cascaded down his back, framing his sharp, handsome features. His smile was as charming as it was chilling, revealing rows of sharp, white teeth.
He said, "I'll take it from here on out, darling."

A subtle but profound shift occurred as He manipulated the very fabric of the pact. Valyndra's influence ebbed away, and Orianna's soul was now bound directly to the Lord of Lies himself. The weight of her previous obligations was lifted, and Orianna was left with an uncertain but newfound sense of autonomy.

As she looked upon the Lord of Lies, Orianna sensed that her path had taken a dramatic and unforeseen turn. She had traded one patron for another, and the schemes of Him, hidden beneath a veneer of charm, would prove to be just as treacherous as the vengeance she had once pursued.

"Now, sleep and you will be born anew."
