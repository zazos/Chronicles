# Descending
[[undersigil_descend.gif|Show To Players]]
<img src="undersigil_descend.gif" class="rightimg">
*You slip through the narrow gap in the alley’s brickwork, and a rush of dank, fetid air hits you like a wave. Torches flicker dimly against slick, mildew-blackened walls, casting wavering shadows down a twisting corridor of cracked stone and dripping pipes. The floor is slick with slimy runoff, each step sending a soft splash echoing through the gloom. Faint, rhythmic drips—somewhere, water seeps through fractured masonry—keep time with the distant rumble of shifting debris.*

*Everywhere, the scent of decay and stagnant water mingles with the sharp tang of half-burned oil. Your boots squelch in muck that rises to ankle-deep in places, dotted with fragments of broken bones and discarded refuse. Suddenly, something skitters past your foot: a gaunt rat, its cranium gleaming in the torchlight. Dozens more skulk among the shadows, their beady eyes reflecting firelight as they dart along the edges of the tunnel, squeaking in warning or hunger—no way to tell which.*

*Ahead, the passage forks unpredictably. Mud-caked ladders and rusted grates lead to lower chambers where the floor’s pitch grows steeper and the air heavier. Walls seam with rust-streaked pipes that gasp out hisses of noxious gas, and jagged roots from the city above thrust through cracks, intertwining with foul-smelling moss. The only clear path weaves downward in a maze of narrow, low-ceilinged reaches: piles of detritus block some routes while others descend into blackness. Somewhere beyond the lip of a crooked turn, you hear wet scraping—perhaps more rodents, or something larger, unseen.*

*As you move deeper, every breath tastes of rot and damp stone. The cacophony of dripping, scuttling, and distant water surges grows louder, as if the sewers themselves are alive. In places, fractured floor slabs reveal roiling brown water below. Along the walls, graffiti scavenged from Sigil’s surface—faded symbols of forgotten cults—hints at the countless souls who’ve dared wander here before. And all the while, the skull-tailed rats swarm: their high-pitched squeals echo through the mist, a constant reminder that you’re far from the city’s bustling streets.

## The Crypt of Sunken Memories
[[Undersigil canals.webp|Show To Players]]
<img src="Undersigil canals.webp" class="rightimg" height=500>
*You pass through a half-collapsed archway and step into a yawning, grotto‐like canal. The vaulted stone ceiling arches overhead, festooned with dripping pipes and tangled ropes that creak when the faint current stirs them. Faint torchlight glints off water lapping at moss‐slathered walls, illuminating a lone, battered skiff tied to a broken pier of rotted planks. The air is thick with damp chill and a rank, briny scent—every breath tastes of stagnant depths. In the distance, the canal narrows into shadowed arches, where slick stepping‐stones and rickety wooden beams hint at the path ahead. Somewhere beneath that ink‐black water, something stirs.*

*Ahead, half‐submerged headstones and the crumbling mouth of a tomb rise from the depths. As you press onward along the slippery stones, the lanterns you carry catch bubbles rising from some unseen source. The silence is broken only by your boots sloshing through cold water… and then, a clatter of stone breaking loose somewhere in the submerged vaults beyond.*


**Background:** This area is the resting place of noble families, whose tombs have been deliberately flooded. The water is not just ordinary water but is imbued with a magical essence that preserves the bodies and traps their spirits. As the players explore, they disturb the restless dead, who rise as Ghostly Wraiths to defend their tomb.

#### **Trigger Event (Passive Start)**
[[sewers_battlemap_grid.png|Battle Map]]
As players cross the ruined, slick stonework of a makeshift bridge (rotted beams, precarious stepping stones), they must succeed a **Group Stealth Check (DC 13)** or **Dexterity (Acrobatics) Check (DC 12)** while crossing or exploring. On a failure, a loud sound echoes through the flooded crypt—**a stone slab collapses, a coffin lid shifts, or a rusted chain snaps**.

*A sudden clatter echoes like a scream in a cathedral. The water trembles. Beneath the surface, a low hum begins to rise, vibrating in your bones. From the depths, pale shapes stir—silhouettes like drowned cloth pulled upward by unseen strings. Then comes the sound—like breath inhaled through hollow lungs, echoed by the canal walls:

*“Disturbance... desecration... remembrance...”*

*[[Undersigil canal spectres.webp|Three ghostly figures]] rise through the water, their forms trailing mist and liquid, eyes glowing with baleful silver light.**

3 [[Spectral Wraith]] appear to attack the characters.

- **Environmental Hazards:** The water here is treacherous, with strong currents and hidden pitfalls. Players must make Dexterity checks to avoid being swept into deeper, more dangerous parts of the crypt.

If the players recognize what they've disturbed (Religion or History DC 14), they may:
- **Leave an offering** (coins, relics, prayer)
- **Invoke a respectful rite** or chant
- **Use magic like _speak with dead_, _gentle repose_, or _calm emotions_**

After some rounds, the remaining spectres delve into the waters only to resurface a turn later transformed into a [[Spectral Beholder]].

Beneath the dark, murky waters, the [[Shar's Undertemple|mausoleum of Lord Enveris]] lie. 


# Arriving at the Heart

Josbert leads the PCs through Undersigil, avoiding dangers and encounters, to their destination, which is an old safe house, only to find it in ruins, burned and ransacked.

>"We used this place once. Or maybe I did. Hard to say. Factionless folk don't really keep good records."

And then, something **shifts**.

## Dreamlike Interlude: The Hearth that Never Was
*Time unravels like smoke. The ruin around them blurs. A flicker of another moment bleeds through.*

![[flashback1_extended.mp3]]

*You are still in the safehouse, but it is whole now. Clean. Lit by low, golden firelight.
The air smells of spiced drink and pipe smoke. The night is quiet—impossibly quiet for Sigil. The city feels far away, like it never existed.
You are here. All of you, tough perhaps not quite as you are now.*

*Someone sings, softly. Another laughs at an old tale, half-true at best. Mugs clink. A sword is being cleaned near the fire. A small trinket is passed hand to hand—maybe a talisman, maybe just a charm.*  

> “You remember this, don’t you?” a voice says—though no one moved their lips.

> “We told this part wrong last time. Let’s try again.”

*A flicker. The firelight grows too bright. Shadows stretch long across the walls like reaching hands. The warmth starts to melt away into static.*

*Then— You blink. The safehouse is once more rubble and silence. Dust in the air. The fire is long dead.*

*In the corner, untouched by time, lies a single item:*

A [[razorvine_platinum_chip.png]]—the stylized currency-token of the Fortune’s Wheel casino. A calling card. An invitation. A memory misplaced.

> *Josbert blinks at it.* “That wasn’t there before.”  
> “Was it?”
> “Uh… mates? We might have a bigger problem than just the Hardheads. This… this is a calling card.”

Josbert informs them about Shemeshka and her casino, but not entirely, due to his memory loss.
Josbert  explains that the casino is owned by Shemeshka and that, during his investigations, he became convinced that Shemeshka's goons (she's rarely there herself) use the private rooms at Fortune's Wheel to get rid of incriminating, stolen valuables at a profit, including portal keys in and out of Sigil: they're basically a black market version of gambling rooms. (He doesn't know that a key can also be won by spinning the Fortune's Wheel.)
