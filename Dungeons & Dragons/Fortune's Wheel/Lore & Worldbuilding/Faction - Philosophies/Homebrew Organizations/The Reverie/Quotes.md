### **Belief as a Weapon**

> _“You believe the Lady watches. You believe the factions matter. You believe the dead stay dead. And so they do—until someone believes otherwise.”_

### **On Death and Rebirth**

> _“You call it resurrection. I call it reimagining. Is a story false if it gives someone a reason to live?”_

### **On Truth**

> _“What is truth, but the lie that lasted the longest?”_

### **On the Gods**

> _“I have seen gods die because no one remembered their names. Tell me—what power is that, if not ours?”_

### **On Saving the Forgotten**

> _“They were broken, yes. But only because the world told them what ‘whole’ meant. I simply offered another definition.”_

### **On the Players (if addressed directly)**

> _“You returned from death, didn’t you? So tell me—what makes your resurrection more ‘real’ than ours?”_
