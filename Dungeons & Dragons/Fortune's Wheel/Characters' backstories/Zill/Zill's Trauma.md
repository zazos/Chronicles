## Bhaal, Lord of Murder

### The False Closure – Blood as Catharsis
<img src="bhaal_dream.webp" class="rightimg" height=500>

- Bhaal, as the Lord of Murder, doesn’t always arrive as a knife in the dark. Sometimes he’s the whisper _after_ vengeance is taken—the **question that twists the knife inside ther soul**.
- The way the entity conjures two stand-ins and executes them horrifically, only to question if it was enough, is _textbook Bhaalism_. It's never enough. There is always _another_ kill, _another_ sin to punish. Bhaal **thrives not just on murder, but on how murder is rationalized**.

### Appeal to the Broken

- Zill is perfect bait. A bard of whispers—_truth turned weapon_. He’s been shaped by betrayal, powerlessness, and a system that rewards abusers.
- Bhaal offers Zill **empowerment masked as justice**, revenge disguised as redemption. It’s not about raw carnage—it’s about **giving pain purpose**. And that’s _Bhaal’s most seductive mask_.
- Let Zill occasionally see **crimson mist** or hear that same **cold voice** whenever he stands at a moral crossroad.
- Bhaal’s influence grows stronger when Zill considers murder not as violence, but as a **moral act**.

> You could have saved them. You can save others. If you have the will.

> Strike. End the cycle. Only blood can wash away blood.

> You sing of sorrow, but your hands are clean. What song will you write when they are stained with justice?

## **Shar, Mistress of the Loss and Forgetting**

### Mercy is Forgetting

- Shar doesn’t want Zill to kill—she wants him to let go. She offers numbness.

> Forget the pain, and it cannot touch you. Let memory drown in shadow.

- When Zill is at his lowest, Shar’s presence is soothing—a cool darkness, the hush of velvet night, a sense of weightlessness. She appears in dreams as a comforting figure, offering to take away the pain.
- Shar tempts Zill to erase his trauma, to abandon vengeance and let the past die. She might even offer to take away his memories entirely.

> Let it go. Forget this pain. It’s not your burden to bear.

- Possible Indoctrination via a Shar-aligned NPC who recognizes Zill's torment and offers him "sanctuary" – a place to forget, to let go. This NPC undermines Bhaal's influence, but the price is Zill's memories, drive and pain.

> Why bear this pain, Zill? Let me cradle your memories in shadow. Rest. Forget. Be free.
