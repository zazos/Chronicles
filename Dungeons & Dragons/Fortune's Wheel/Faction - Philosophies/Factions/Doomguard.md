*Who Celebrate Destruction and Decay*

![[FactionDoomguard5e.webp | 300]]

**Factol**: Pentar

**Headquarters**: Armory

**Aligned Plane**: Elemental Chaos

**Members**: Entropists, soldiers, weaponsmiths

**Epithet**: Sinkers

The Doomguard understands the purpose of everything is to crumble. Existence inevitably falls into ruin—nothing lasts forever, not even the gods.

Sinkers don’t stand in the way of the multiverse’s destruction. They see decay and entropy as entirely natural, something to be fostered in its own time.

They don’t recklessly hasten destruction or oppose creation. Instead, they see that every act of creation is intrinsically tied to destruction. Trees must be felled and stone cut to build a house, and the house must eventually burn, rot, or wither away.

The highest-ranking Doomguard members aside from the factol are the doom lords, who each oversee a faction citadel built at the edge of the Elemental Chaos.

The Doomguard’s leader is the fearless Factol Pentar (human Doomguard doom lord), who revels in danger and decay. Pentar has come to blows with Harmonium patrols on many occasions. She toys with the idea of aligning with the Hands of Havoc, hoping to toss a spark into the mass of dry razorvine that is Sigil.

**Faction Attire**. Members of the Doomguard garb themselves in the bones of long-dead creatures and deliberately allow their weapons and gear to rust. Sinkers display their scars proudly.

**Role in Sigil**. The Doomguard controls the Armory in Sigil and oversees the production and sale of weapons in the city. Thanks to the quality and number of armaments required by the factions, the Doomguard holds leverage in many interfactional negotiations. 
The Doomguard bears a long, bitter, mutual enmity toward the Harmonium, and the Fraternity of Order rejects the Doomguard’s philosophy entirely. Sinkers have strong allies in both the Bleak Cabal and the Heralds of Dust.

## All Will Be Dust

The Sinkers are a funny bunch, and no screed. And by that I mean funny in the brain-box, not funny haha, cutter. They claim that the Multiverse is in a constant state of decay; things are wearing down and breaking; life grinds itself to a halt. Maybe they’ve got a point…just count the number of civilisations that’ve brought destruction to themselves after growing too large…the **Blood War** to name but one (though a cutter who called the fiends “civilised” would need his brain-box looking at).

The Doomguard, then, revel in the falling down, and rather than try to prevent things collapsing they cherish it in all its forms; decay, rust, corruption. You’d think that they’d also support the Anarchists’ incessant demands for the dismantling of the factions (after all, that’s entropy ain’t it), but, curiously, the Sinkers ain’t keen on the idea. Maybe they ain’t the selfless philosophers I’ve painted them to be…
