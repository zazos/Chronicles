# The Mind Rot: A price to Pay

The Red Circuit knows that augmenting the body beyond its limits comes with a cost.

There is a mental instability that occurs when someone merges too many implants with their organic mind, turning them into unstable, violent cyber-beasts. The Church of Experiment denies its existence, calling it an "unrefined neurological imbalance", but the Red Circuit has seen it firsthand. 

#### The Syndrome: "The Flicker"

Common name: The Flicker (short for "Neural Flicker Syndrome")
Street Slang: "Redshift", "Wireburn"
Symptoms:
- Fractured Identity: The mind struggles to process its artificial parts, leading to split personalities or complete mental breakdowns.
- Neural Overload: Victims experience glitches in memory, forgetting who they are or acting in erratic, violent ways. 
- Sensory Bleed: Those suffering the Flicker often hallucinate, as their synthetic senses blend with reality, making them dangerously unpredictable. 
- Impulse Surge: Many sufferers become hyper-aggressive, seeing non-augmented people as obstacles or threats.
- Reboot Syndrome: In rare cases, a sufferer's implants take over completely, reducing them to nothing but a machine-controlled husk.

#### What Causes It?

The Flicker is most commonly triggered by:
- Excessive Augmentations: Adding too many cybernetics at once.
- Glitched Enhancements: Implants that were not properly calibrated and repaired, leading to neural desynchronisation.
- Experimental Tech: Many of the Church's prototype implants are untested, often leading to neurological disorders.
- Rejection Syndrome: Some bodies just can't handle the metal, and the mind shatters under the strain. 

#### What Happens to Those Who Suffer?

- The Red Circuit calls them Flickers - broken machines that once were people.
- Many turn violent and have to be put down before they become rampaging cyber-beasts.
- The Church quietly collects those who suffer - but no one knows what happens to them afterward.

### The Red Circuit's View on the Flicker

- "If you can't handle the upgrade, you were never meant to survive." The Red Circuit does not coddle the weak. If you push yourself too far and fall into Flicker madness, then you were never meant to ascend in the first place. 
- "We fix our own". If a Red Circuit member starts Flickering, their friends will try to rewire their implants manually, hoping to restore them.
- "Mercy is the last upgrade". If a Flicker goes too far, they are given a "Hard Shutdown" - a clean execution by their comrades, usually with a high voltage neural blast.
