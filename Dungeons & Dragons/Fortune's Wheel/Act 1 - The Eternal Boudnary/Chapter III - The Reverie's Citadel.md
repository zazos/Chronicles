The Reverie have positioned a small island of rock at the portal's terminus in the Elemental Plane of Fire. This island is an asteroid of black stone, surrounded by a 100-yard zone of breathable air. The air is maintained by an enchanted gem. Outside this safe zone, the endless inferno rages for as far as the eye can see. The Citadel was once the palace of an efreeti prince, but has been abandoned for hundreds of years. The Reverie use it as a base in the plane of Fire. Its location is ideal for sorting the deaders who come through the Mortuary portal. The bodies marked by Toranna in the Mortuary are set aside for revival later, and the rest thrown into the flames. Once a barmy has been revived, Reverie clerics and wizards work to cure or suppress the victim's insanity. When the victim is lucid again, a charade of divine intervention is set up to get the barmy to willingly serve as an agent of the Reverie. About once a week, Veylith's agents activate the Lower Ward portal and transport the new recruits back to Sigil.

# 1 - Receiving Platform

As long as a character has a **red glass bead**, the portal can be opened at will. The portal overlooks the flames of the Elemental Plane of Fire, 3 feet above the terrace level. 

*You find yourselves stumbling onto a wide flagstone terrace, a low curb rings it. Behind and above you, a wall of sheer rock bars the way. A set of stone stairs ascends away from the terrace along the cliff face. The platform looks out over the Elemental Plane of Fire, a raging inferno that surrounds the rocky island entirely. A bottomless gulf of flame lies beneath the platform. 
Four armed men regard you with suspicion when you arrive on the platform. 
"I don't know who you are or where you thought you were going, but you've come to the wrong place, berk" says one.  "Drop your weapons!"*

![[plane of fire entrance.png]]

Three of the men are Reverie Guards and the fourth is Alver Kend, a Reverie priest who supervises the handling of the barmies on the platform. 
If a fight breaks out, Alver orders one of the guards to alert the Citadel. 
If any of them are interrogated, the know roughly what is in each room and how the operation works. They also know that the gem in Area 10 must not be disturbed for any reason, since it renews the safe pocket surrounding the Citadel.

# 2 - Guard Platform

*A platform of stone juts out from the side of the cliff. Five well-armed hobgoblins keep an alert watch over the area. A ballista sits loaded and drawn in the center of the platform, mounted on a swinging pivot.
The hobgoblins challenge you as you ascend the stairs: "Halt! Who goes there?"*

![[plane of fire ballistae.png]]

These hobgoblins are mercenaries hired by Veylith to keep the Citadel safe. 


# 3 - Lower Gallery

Barmies who tend toward evil alignment are led through this hallway on their way to meet the "avatar" of their patron deity. Lower planes related. 

*This hallway is decorated with sinister carvings and dark wall trappings. The alcoves hold statues of fierce fiends in various grotesque poses. A gate of black iron lies at the end of the hall, emblazoned with terrible runes and curses. Broken bones and rusted pieces of armour litter the floor of this passageway.*

Door is trapped with a *glyph of warding*: requires a secret gesture to open safely.
Otherwise, character suffers X effects and a magic mouth proclaims: "FOOL! NOW YOU SHALL RECEIVE THE PUNISHMENT YOU DESERVE! ADVANCE INTO THE HALL OF JUDGEMENT"

# 4 - Lower Hall

This chamber is the stage for barmies who are meeting the Lower Planar "powers". It doubles as a meeting hall and refectory; when theatrical trappings are needed, the tables are removed and the kitchens closed down. At the moment, several hobgoblins are removing the tables in preparation for a divine performance.

*The walls are covered by dark tapestries, or arrases. A throne of black stone rests on a dais at the room's far end. Smoking braziers stand at either side of the throne. Several hobgoblins are carrying tables from the centre of this room to niches hidden by the arrases. Six tables have already been stowed, and four remain the room's centre.*

![[plane of fire lower hall.png]]

The hobgoblins think that they are new reinforcements and let the heroes pass unless they do something out of the ordinary or the alarm has been raised. 

The curtained alcoves contain various supplies, totalling six barrels of salted meat, 35 sacks of grain, four sides of curing beef, two picks, three axes, two hammers, a keg of nails, four 50-foot coils of rope and for kegs of weak ale.

# 5 - Guard Quarters

*This is a military bunkroom, with over a dozen bunks and heavy footlockers lining the walls. An equipment rack sits in the centre of the room. Three arrow slits look out over the raging fires outside. Lurid orange light blazes through the slits. Four hobgoblins are throwing dice in the corner. As you enter, the hobgoblins leap up and seize their weapons, rushing to the attack!*

A search of this room reveals three suits of scale mail, a set of cloaks emblazoned with a lidless eye (The Reverie symbol), five spears, two long bows, and 24 arrows. The foot lockers contain a total of 78 jink, 155 greens.

The hobgoblins were enlisted by Veylith in Plague-Mort and know that people are received in Area 1, detained in Area 16 and then sent off from Area 13. They don't know why.

# 6 - The Kitchen

The kitchen is small and not well equipped, the guards eat more cold meals than hot ones.
A single dirty hearth takes up one wall of this dingy kitchen. A few counters and bare cupboards line the other walls of this room. Two burly men in aprons are cooking a stew over the hearth.
Like the hobgoblins in the previous rooms, the cooks assume that the PCs are newly arrived reinforcements unless the party picks a fight. 

# 7 - Grand Stair

This passageway connects the Lower Hall with the Upper Landing. 

*A set of wide, red marble stairs climbs steeply upwards toward a large double door at the upper landing, ascending in three 20-foot flights.* 
*The ceiling is a high, pointed arch 25 feet overhead. Several doors can be seen at the landings of the stairway and a pair of threatening statues occupies the middle landing. The two statues depict leering gargoyles. *

![[plane of fire stairs.png|400]]

The gargoyles are trap: if someone steps on a special trigger stone in the middle of the landing (trapfinding), the gargoyles shoot roaring flames from their open mouths. 

# 8 - Battle Landing

An equipped ballista and 10 spears for the engine stand alone in this platform. Several large barrels of water, shovels and blankets are nearby for fighting fires. 

# 9 - Guard Towers

Standing on a pinnacle of rock, this tower doubles as a bunkroom, storehouse and armory. The tower is actually three levels tall; the level beneath the one shown on the map is the armory, and the level above is a rooftop battle platform with a ballista mount.
Inside the tower are four Reverie guards, including two archers. Two more are on the tower's roof. Bunks and lockers are provided for about a dozen soldiers, but some of the guards are on duty elsewhere. The tower's door is made of iron and kept locked.
If the PCs engage the two outer guards in a fight, the archers inside the tower and on the roof will join the fight.
The lockers contain a variety of arms and equipment, including three suits of leather armor, five short swords, two short bows, and 45 arrows. A total of 35 jink and 68 greens can be collected in a small coinage. The armory downstairs stores 12 spears, two suits of chain mail, and four medium shields. Iron rations for 200 man-days and six barrels of water are also kept here.

# 10 - Upper Hall

A white marble temple. This building and the tower are the only structures above the island's surface. 
Inside, a great altar of white stones rests under a dome at the end of the building. The Reverie priest Brandal and his acolyte Margram keep this building in pristine condition. Two Reveries guards stand beside the door; Brandal and Margram are engaged in a ceremony.

![[Brandal and Margram.webp|300]]
[[Brandal and Margram.webp|Show to Players]]

*"Let the forgotten be known once more. Let the broken be remade. By the word of the Unwritten, we erase despair, we forge anew, weâ€”"*

*The priest falters, his voice cutting off. The guards move to intercept. He turns, eyes narrowing as he takes a step forward.*

*Ah... interruptions. It seems our revelations are of great interest to the blind.*

*Go check in with Imogen before you start wandering around*

And he dispatches one of the guards to lead the party to Area 15.

The [[Emberheart Core|jewel]] on the altar has been enchanted by Veylith to maintain an atmosphere of cool air around the rock island. If the gem is shattered or removed from the rock, the Citadel's atmosphere begins to collapse. The PCs instantly notice an increase in the temperature that quickly grows intolerable. They have 2 turns to escape before the atmosphere fails entirely and the place is overcome by the surrounding flames.

Brandal is on the details of the Eternal Boundary plan and helps to restore the barmies and bubbers sent here. 

If the PCs insist on learning more about the **Reverie**, Brandal, who's already occupied at the moment, will be dismissive but pointed. He won't waste time preaching ideology, just enough to bait their curiosity. 

- *The Reverie is a second chance. For those discarded, forgotten, broken. A chance to wake up as something greater, something true. But i doubt you're here for that.*
As he continues his work, barely sparing the PCs a glance.

- *Veylith teaches that death is a failure of the imagination. That we are more than the limits imposed by us. And yet, you come to stop us - why? What are you so afraid?*

If the PCs get a chance to search this room, they'll find two potions of vitality, two elixirs of health, and four potions of healing in a secret compartment in the altar.

Beneath one of the statues in the circular alcoves there is a concealed trap-door that leads to a secret passage to Area 15, Imogen's chambers. This passageway is trapped by a sepia snake sigil.

# 11 - Empty Quarters

A dozen of empty bunks and footlockers, with empty weapon racks and armor stands fill the room. 

# 12 - Upper Terrace

Located on the upper surface of the island, this is the second-highest point of the Citadel. Only the tower and the temple stand higher. The terrace is used for assemblies and musters of the guard detachments.
*You find a broad, open courtyard ringed by stone battlements overlookin the flames that rage around the Citadel. A pair of fortified iron-plated doors seems to lead into the hillside at the terrace's southern end. Standing at the far end of the terrace is a huge stone statue of an armored man looking out over the terrace. And as you approach, the statue turns to look at you, then turns away.
A squad of four armed men challenge you as your approach.*

If a fight breaks out, one of the guards runs inside and heads for Area 16 to get help and spread the alarm.
If the PCs came from inside (Area 7), the guard leaves by the eastern walkway and heads for the tower (Area 9). 1d4+2 rounds for reinforcements. 

The statue has been placed here by Veylith to defend against fire elementals; ignores all other intruders.

# 13 - Veylith's Portal

This portal, pre-existing Veylith, leads to a dark alleyway in the Lower Ward of Sigil. 
Veylith and his followers can travel from Plague-Mort to the Citadel by taking a trade portal to Sigil and then using this portal to travel from Sigil to the Elemental Plane of Fire.
The key to the portal is difficult. A passwall spell must be cast on the portal, opening it instead of creating its normal effect. Since only Veylith is capable of casting the spell, the Reverie use the Mortuary to handle the shipment of recruits. 

*This platform hands out over the abyss of fire from the lowest point of the island. In the cliff wall that boarders the platform, a circle of glassy obsidian has been inlaid to form a doorway in the rock. Two armed men in scale mail stand guard here. As you approach, they look surprised and ask, "When did you cutters get here?  Are you our relief? You're late!*

The guards mistake the PCs for their relief. They also try to flee if a fight breaks out it it looks like they're outnumbered. Additionally, they don't know the key to the portal, only that Veylith can open it by casting some kind of spell.

# 14 - Officer's Quarters

Imogen's lieutenants use this chamber as their living quarters. Room is shared by the chief priest Brandal, his assistant, the hobgoblin chief Hurfang and Captain of the Guards Trent. Brandal and his assistant are in the temple, Hurfang and Trent are here.

*The bunkroom has been rearranged into private quarters. Curtains divide the room, and comfortable bunks and desks can be seen in each area. In the room's center an oaken table and wooden chairs double as a conference area and officers' mess. A burly human in plate mail and a tough-looking hobgoblin are looking over some rosters. As you enter, the human and hobgoblin quickly rise "You're not ours," the human says.*

![[Hurfang and Trent.png|300]]

Both Hurfang and Trent call for guards. Unless the PCs can silence them quickly, Imogen hears them from Area 15 and comes to their aid with her bodyguards in 1d3 rouns. Hurfang and Trent fight to the death, expecting no quarter. 

Hurfang growls: *You think you're the first to come here, blades drawn? You'll leave the same as the rest - charred.*

Trent scoffs and says: *You should have walked away. Now you're just another name we'll erase.*

A search of the cubicles turns up a total 360 jink, 446 greens. 
Brandal's trunk contains a holy symbol (which deity?) and four vials of holy water.

# 15 - Imogen's Quarters

Imogen is Commander of the Citadel and supervises its operations. She is also the only wizard of the garrison. Her quarters are patrolled by two bodyguards who are stationed outside the door. 

*Two warriors in plate mail stand outside this door, weapons at the ready. They challenge you as you approach.
Inside, the commander's chambers are spacious and well furnished. The outer room is an office, the inner room is a sleeping chamber. Both are furnished with comfortable leather couches and rosewood desks and tables. Behind the great desk sits a tall githzerai in gray robes. A shield full of books is behind her. When you enter, she looks up "i wasn't advised of any new arrivals," she drawls suspiciously.*

![[Imogens quarters.png]]

A locked drawer in her desk contains a potion of healing, a sack of red glass beads, a pouch of seven 100 gp diamonds, and a scroll with three passwall spells (portal key to lower ward) on it. Other drawers contain correspondence from Veylith directing Imogen to "command the Citadel and guard it from any attack."
The bookshelves contain a total of 60 tomes, most of them mundane, but one shelf also contains oil of elemental invulnerability and a wand of illusion.
In Imogen's private chambers there is a locked trunk guarded by a spring loaded dart trap. The trunk contains 650 jink, 440 greens and a scroll of protection from elements. 
Beneath her bed there's a secret flagstone that reveals a small compartment. The compartment contains her spellbook. 

# 16 - Guest Chambers

Barmies and bubbers who are being evaluated or cured are kept here in locked cells. Currently there are four barmies who are undergoing treatment. The room has nine stone cells along the southern wall and an open area which doubles as a guardroom. Three Reverie members are standing watch here.
The guards raise the alarm if anything unusual happens, alerting other guards in Area 12. These guards know that the barmies are being treated and then. deceived into believing they have died and been resurrected, but they don't know how the priests are going about it. 

![[Guest chambers barmies.png]]
![[Guest chambers barmies 2.png|500]]

The barmies are named Alvion, Clarent, Shillman and Ulfwood. Each of them was a prime adventurer who was driven insane by the sheer reality of the planes beyond their own words. With a little time and magical assistance (charm person, suggestion, and remove fear all have proven useful), these borderline cases can be restored to full sanity. Unfortunately, most barmies don't get that kind of help whey they arrive in Sigil as crackpots. 


##### Alvion (Silent Zealot, Lawful Good Cleric) â€“ Wonâ€™t Speak to the PCs, Sees Them as Fiends
- Sits cross-legged in his cell, eyes closed, muttering a prayer to himself, refusing to acknowledge the PCs
- *Fiends, devils, whisperers in the dark - you think i don't know temptation when i see it? You have no power over me! I will ascend, and you will be nothing but dust at my feet.*
- (To Ulfwood, whispering through the bars): *Ignore them. They are the test before the reward, sent to shake our faith. But i have seen the signs. The moment is close.*

##### Ulfwood (Stoic, Resigned, True Believer) â€“ Dismissive of the PCs
- *I have waited patiently for my judgement, and i will wait longer if needed. The gods know my soul.* (Doesn't look at the PCs)
- (To Alvion, thoughtfully): *Strange, though... Purgatory. It feels... mundane. I imagined something greater. A test of fire and will. Here... only fire.*
- (If the PCs try to argue with him): *What you say means nothing. You are but shades, illusions conjured to rattle my faith. I shall not be swayed.*

##### Clarent (Chaotic Neutral Fighter) â€“ A Brash, Easily-Led Instigator, Spoiling for a Fight
- (He kicks at the bars, grinning at the PCs like a dog eager to be let loose.) *Oi, 'bout time someone interesting showed up! What's the test, eh? A brawl? A trial by combat? I'll gut whatever bastard i have to for my ticket out!*
- (To the others, exasperated) *You lot sit around waiting for your gods like pigeons in a bloody cage! I'm makin' my own fate! First bastard who walks in here talkin' like a celestial, i'm putting a fist through 'is jaw and taking my spot in the afterlife!*
- (To Shillman, mockingly) *What's wrong with you, priest? Look like someone fed you sour milk. Ain't this your dream? A new start? A second chance? Thought holy folk live for this nonsense.*

##### Shillman (Neutral Disillusioned Cleric)â€“ Broken, Confused, and Lost in His Own Doubt
- (Muttering under his breath, staring at his hands): *This... this isn't what was promised. No gates. No radiance. No song of the afterlife. Just... stone walls and whispers. Have i done something wrong? Was my faith not enough?*
- (To Clarent, shaking his head): *This isn't what the texts spoke of. There should be angels, the scent of myrrh in the iar, the embrace of my god. Why do i feel nothing?*
- (To the PCs, blinking slowly, hollow-voiced) *Are you real? I don't... i don't know what's real anymore.*


# The Reverie

Imogen eventually realized that the Citadel is under attack and swiftly mobilizes the base's defenses. She takes her two bodyguards, Hurfang and Trent from Area 15, and the four guards who were off duty inside the guard tower (Area 9)
Wherever the PCs are, she tracks them down and confronts them. This encounter should occur about 1-3 turns after the PCs have done something to raise suspicion. 

*You hear the creaking of armor and heavy footsteps just ahead. Suddenly, a band of armed men escorting a tall githzerai woman appear. Steel rasps as the guards d raw their swords. The githzerai holds them back with a gesture. "You have no idea who you're dealing with, " she hisses angrily. 
"We are the Reverie, and we don't allow fools like you to interfere in our plans! You've been scragged, the lot of you. Surrender now, or it'll be the Flames!"*

# The Flames

If the PCs destroy or remove the gem:

*You see the dazzling blue glow of the gem suddenly flare to bright orange and then burn out, dead black. The gem is worthless. Immediately, the muted roaring of flames you've been hearing the whole time becomes a thundering blast that almost deafens you. The temperature begins to climb rapidly. In less than a minute, you are sweating heavily. In three minutes, combustibles such as paper begin to smolder and smoke. You realize you have to flee now, or you will never get out!*
