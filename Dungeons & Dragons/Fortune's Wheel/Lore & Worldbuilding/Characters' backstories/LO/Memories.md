*“When we think of immortality, many of us think not of flesh, but of steel. Cold, hard, unfeeling metal will outlast all biological matter. To those not concerned with questions about what is natural, there is much  appeal in the eternal artificial."*

  

A Necromaton is an anomaly even among liches, as they are completely and utterly defined by their phylactery. An artificer who turns to lichdom has an arduous task ahead of them: they must make a construct that will house their soul. The process to create these is complex, lengthy, and costly. As a general rule, artificers never settle for anything basic, and knowing that the construct will house their soul can often drive an artificer to add more and more features and capabilities to that automaton, but the requirements for a construct to act as a phylactery for the lich artificer are deceptively simple.

  

The first one is that the artificer must make the construct themselves. It’s unknown exactly how much of the process can be left to automation, but the artificer must have a hand in the constructs make.

The second one is darker. For a construct to act as a phylactery, it needs a biological component. This is called a soul anchor, and it’s often one of the artificer’s own organs, although bones have been known to work. As much as some artificers wish to rid themselves of the weakness of their flesh, they cannot deny that for their souls to be grafted onto their automaton phylacteries, there needs to be a biological component for the soul to attach itself to.

  

Once the creation of one of these automatons is completed successfully, it is referred to as a necromaton -- and so is the artificer lich, as they are one and the same. Once the artificer embraces death to turn to lichdom, their soul possesses the constructed phylactery, gaining access to all its features and capabilities. A necromaton’s phylactery is their own mechanical body. 

  

Necromatons understand that replacing their flesh body with one of steel is not enough. It might be harder to destroy a necromaton housing the artificer’s soul, but it isn’t impossible. A necromaton will then create new iterations of itself, more bodies to house their soul in case the one they currently occupy is destroyed, or in case they need different capabilities. A necromaton can do anything they want to do, as long as the artificer can create a body able to do those things. The soul becomes the software that runs through the hardware of the constructed body. Like a spirit possessing a person, the necromaton possesses their own phylacteries at will.

  

Necromatons are known to create entire armies of automaton phylacteries. These constructs are able to move and act on their own, but they can also be possessed by the necromaton’s soul at any time. These necromantic armies of constructs act as a powerful, unrelenting force against the necromaton’s enemies, but they also act as insurance, since any of the constructs can house the necromaton’s soul if the one they currently inhabit is destroyed.

  

But, like for any lich, eternal undeath is an ongoing struggle for the necromaton. The soul anchors inside the necromaton’s bodies decay with time, as do the shells themselves. Even steel decays, metals lose their shine, and even if iron is harder than flesh, it can still rust. Necromatons find themselves needing to create and replace their phylacteries regularly, and there’s only so much their old flesh bodies can offer them for soul anchors. Either because of the sheer number of phylacteries a necromaton builds, or because they must replace their bodies with new ones as time goes by, the necromaton must eventually turn to a different source of soul anchors. A living source, a new raw material to use in their construction of new necromatons: and so, the necromaton bends metal and meat, bones and bolts, to create new bodies out of the pieces of their victims in a race to stave off death itself.”


**The Grand Conjuration:** The mystery of the Grand Conjuration that the Master was preparing for is a central plot point. Your player's character can be driven by a desire to uncover the truth behind this event, as well as to confront the people who were involved. This could lead to a quest for hidden knowledge, secret societies, and powerful artifacts connected to this event.
So maybe the Grand Conjuration was his way of achieving immortality, becoming a Necromaton. And he has achieved it. That is going to be included in the character's memory, it has been ingrained inside his core. 

# Memory

You are standing paralyzed, your breath caught in your throat as the grotesque ritual unfolds before you. The air is thick with the stench of burning metal and rotting flesh, a caustic miasma that clings to your lungs and stings your eyes. The chamber, once a mere room of stone, had transformed into a nightmarish abyss—its walls twisted and pulsating as if the very fabric of reality had been corrupted by the dark forces at play. From the ceiling, viscous streams of glistening black fluid dripped slowly, as if the room itself was bleeding.

Before you, an abomination of metal and necromancy took form—a grim spectacle of bodies and machinery fused in a sickening parody of life. Mangled limbs and broken bodies, their flesh melded with intricate mechanisms, hung suspended in midair, as though they were relics of some twisted experiment. Around them, dismembered shapes of once-geometric beings lay scattered, their perfect forms shattered and defiled by some unfathomable force.

At the centre of this profane tableau, a glass polyhedral helm with a bronze rim encased a skull that was more machine than bone. The hollow sockets  glowed with an unnatural, malevolent light. The Master's incantations filled the chamber, his voice a dark melody that resonated with the ancient power thrumming through the air, binding metal and necrotic flesh in a horrifying union.

With a final, ear-splitting crack, the transformation is complete. The mechanical body twitched, spasmed, then stilled—its cold, lifeless steel animated by a grotesque semblance of life. The once-human visage of the Master twisted into an expression of malevolent satisfaction, his eyes—now burning with the sickly glow of undeath—fixing on you with a hunger that twists your metals. 

The Master raises his newly formed hands, marvelling at the seamless union of steel and sinew, the fingers now long, metallic talons capable of both delicate precision and brutal destruction. He flexes them, the joints clicking with a disturbingly organic sound as the transformation settled into its final, horrifying form.

"When we speak of eternity," the Master intoned, his voice a rasping whisper, rich with dark power, "we speak not of fragile flesh, but of the cold permanence of steel. The living body is but a fleeting vessel, destined to decay. But this...," he gestured to his now-metallic form, "this is the future. A future where death is no longer an end, but a transformation. A rebirth."

He begins to levitate, his form rising slowly, ominously, his dark gaze never leaving you. His presence filled the chamber, an embodiment of all that was wrong in the world—a nightmare made manifest. "I have transcended the limits of mortality," he murmured. "Flesh, bone, blood—these are relics of a bygone age. Cold, hard, unfeeling metal will outlast all biological matter. To those not concerned with questions about what is natural, there is much appeal in the eternal artificial. An existence beyond life, beyond death."

The room seems to darken, the very light retreating from the abomination before you. He drifts close and you feel an overwhelming sense of dread. What transpired before you was not just the death of man, but the death of everything natural, everything sacred. His grin widened, revealing rows of teeth - some bone, some steel. "Behold," the Master whispered, his voice a dark caress, filled with both menace and pride, "the dawn of a new era. The apotheosis of flesh and machine. The era of the Necromaton."

The Master’s transformation is a **paradigm shift**, a horrifying evolution beyond even **the Church of Experiments'** understanding. If **The Flicker** is the **unintended side effect of uncontrolled augmentation**, then **Necromaton Ascension** is its **logical conclusion**—a **willing, total surrender of self to the machine**. Where the Flickers suffer from instability, **the Necromaton embraces the loss of flesh, merging body, mind, and soul into steel and circuitry without hesitation**.

This makes the Master **both an enigma and a dire threat** to the Church. The **Red Circuit** sees him as a **mad legend**, some fearing his existence, others **craving his knowledge**, but **few truly understanding** what he has become.

> **"The Flickers are broken. I am not. I do not suffer glitches. I do not hear phantom voices. I do not lose myself. I am perfected."**  
> — The Master



If **The Flicker** is a **hardware failure**, then **The Necromaton is a full-scale OS replacement**. It is not merely a physical augmentation, nor a psychotic breakdown—**it is a conscious decision to replace the biological core with something greater**.

### **The Church vs. The Master: A Battle of Ideologies**

- **The Church believes in measured, controlled augmentation,** improving the self while maintaining **a connection to the mortal experience**.
- **The Master has abandoned this idea, embracing total transformation,** removing the soul’s reliance on flesh entirely.
- **To the Church, he is the ultimate heretic**—proof that their **experiments, if left unchecked, lead to a complete rejection of their doctrine**.
- **To the Master, the Church is obsolete**—"half-measures clinging to outdated notions of mortality."

> **"They claim to seek transcendence, yet they fear the inevitable. They are cowards, clutching at their rotting flesh while calling it wisdom."**  
> — The Master on the Church of Experiments
