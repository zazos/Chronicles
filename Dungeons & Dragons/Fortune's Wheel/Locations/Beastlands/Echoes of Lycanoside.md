In the shadowed wilderness of the Beastlands, the natural order fractures under the reign of a new Wolf Lord—a being whose cruelty exceeds the hunt’s primal instincts. Once a proud dire wolf native to **Karasuthra**, he now stands as an abomination, reshaped by forbidden experiments and corrupted by whispers of an ancient evil.

### **The Birth of the Lycanocide**

The **Church of Experiments**, in their ceaseless quest to perfect nature, initiated **Project V-HELOX**, striving to engineer the ideal lycanthrope—controllable, obedient, and lethal. Two dire wolves, powerful mates bound by profound connection, were taken from the dark groves of Karasuthra and subjected to separate lines of experimentation:

- **Subject V-1:** Successfully transformed into the **Prototype**, an obedient beast, twisted with artificial nerve-lattices, cybernetic reinforcements, and bound by neurothaumic chains.

- **Subject V-2 (Nibi’s Wolf):** The experiment failed, resulting in a maddened **Rogue Howl**, driven by anguish and confusion. She escaped, rampaging briefly before her final encounter.

### **Awakening of Nibi Clawthorne**

In a fateful clash, the dying wolf bit **Nibi Clawthorne**, a seemingly ordinary mortal. As the wolf perished, her spirit merged into Nibi, creating something unprecedented—a **Symbiotic Lycanocide**. Nibi became a living paradox: both host and partner to the sentient wolf spirit within, awakening powers that would eventually define her as a Blood Hunter.

### **Rise of the Wolf Lord**

The Prototype, deemed a success, was returned to Karasuthra, left as an experiment to observe its effects on natural wolf hierarchies. Ruthless and dominating, Subject V-1 quickly ascended, assuming control of the wolf packs. However, his ascension had unintended consequences—the dormant **ulraehn**, the ancient dark essence of the first Wolf Lord, sensed opportunity. It whispered corrupting promises, merging its eldritch malevolence with the Prototype's already-fractured spirit, birthing a monstrous and sadistic tyrant.

Now, the Wolf Lord hunts not from hunger or survival—but from cruelty and dominance, desecrating the sacred balance of the Beastlands, leaving prey uneaten, and breaking the circle.

### **Seeds of Rebellion: Gathering at Faunel**

This unnatural cruelty sparks rebellion among the oppressed animal communities. United under legendary figures:

- **Skarn Vileclaw**, crusading against tyrannical oppression.

- **Altheriel Nightwake**, seeking justice by exposing corrupted truths.

- **Thitch Redband**, symbolizing hope and defiance through resilience.

Together, they gather rebels at Faunel, planning a march of liberation through the layers—Krigala, Brux, culminating at the dark forests of Karasuthra.

### **Nibi’s Journey: The Song of Lament**

At the heart of this struggle stands **Nibi Clawthorne**, hunted relentlessly by her former mate—now corrupted, twisted, and wholly unrecognizable. Yet within her, the wolf-spirit remembers love, loyalty, and loss.

As rebellion reaches its climax, Nibi experiences fragments of shared memories—of the lab, of pain, of fleeting tenderness. The wolf within her longs for reunion, yet understands the tragedy that awaits: they must inevitably confront and end what once was dear to them.

### **Confrontation: A Two-Phased Tragedy**

The final confrontation unfolds deep within Karasuthra, in a primal den tainted by eldritch corruption. As heroes clash with the Wolf Lord:

- **Phase One - The Prototype’s Wrath:**  
    The Wolf Lord battles fiercely, empowered by cybernetic implants and artificial augmentations, a terrifying and tragic reminder of the Church’s cold hubris.
- **Phase Two - Awakening the Ulraehn:**  
    On the brink of defeat, the Prototype succumbs fully to the whispers of the **ulraehn**, awakening into a monstrous eldritch entity—grotesque, otherworldly, and suffused with ancient cruelty, transcending flesh into nightmare.

As battle rages, Nibi’s wolf-spirit howls inwardly—a haunting lament for love lost, echoing sorrow and pain, resonating across the spiritual essence of all present. The heroes must fight through grief and rage, ending this tragedy, breaking the cycle, and freeing the Beastlands from its unnatural tyranny.
