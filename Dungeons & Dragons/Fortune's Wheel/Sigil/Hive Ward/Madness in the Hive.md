# The Hive is Forsaken: Why Madness Grows Here

The Hive is not cursed by chance—it is shaped by neglect, cruelty, and belief.

### Deliberate Abandonment

- Other Wards treat the Hive as a dumping ground for the unsolvable: the poor, the addicted, the barmy.
- Harmonium patrols avoid it. Fraternity of Order doesn’t file writs here. Mercykillers sometimes _recruit_ from here.
- New portals are built _out_ of the Hive—not into it.

It is a social pressure valve, designed to keep Sigil’s chaos localized.

### Barmies and Belief-Filth

- The Hive has the highest concentration of untreated madness in the Cage.
- The delusions, hallucinations, and superstitions of the Barmies have steeped into the cobblestones.
- In Sigil, belief is dangerous—and in the Hive, belief festers.

> The Hive doesn't just warp the mind—the mind warps the Hive.


### Phenomena Born from the Wound

- **The Laughing Fog**: A giggling vapor that infects minds. Began as a paranoid rumour, now infects alleys at random.
- **The Apiary Crone**: Once folklore, now seen. Wears a wicker helm, trades in wax memories, steals purpose.
- **Shifting Alleyways**: Alleys that change position or destination when no one’s looking.
- **Echoes of Crimes Unanswered**: Some buildings whisper past violence, replaying murders or betrayals like hauntings.
