- **Huggingface tokens storing**
	- The token `Vision Transformers` has been saved to /Users/pzazos/.cache/huggingface/stored_tokens
	- Your token has been saved to /Users/pzazos/.cache/huggingface/token

- **Natalia call for Deployment**
	- Inside MANOLO Base probably
	- converter: Datasets -> Manolo Datasets
		- Datasets to specific format (συμβαση)
		- input: abstract -> Manolo Format
		- given any dataset (Domain agnostic), developers not extra effort to load
		- Natalia exposes Manolo loader -> UseCase provider converts and exposes a Data Loader -> We call a Data Loader to implement things.
	- Controller: Server that has docker images
	- In python packages generalised.
	- A folder for xAI and the other folder for experiments.
		- The second folder is not package (tester).
			- All the loadings, preprocessing, etc.
		- xAI packets is overly abstract, not specific. Simple functionality.
	- 2nd stage is to convert them to python packages.
	- Technically no setup is apparent. 


- **VisionTrasnformer**
	- Tutorial from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/fine_tuning_vit_custom_dataset) on breastcancer. Not capable running that fine-tuning on mac.
	- Goal was to learn how to fine-tune Vision Transformer (ViT) on a different image dataset that the one it was trained on (ImageNet)
