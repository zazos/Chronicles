An explorer mimir was once trampled under the hooves of a small herd of **armanite tanar’ri** during a trip to the **[Abyss](https://mimir.net/planes/abyss/)**. The mimir suffered many grievous dents to its pate, and ceased functioning. Its owner at the time—lucky to have survived the Abyss herself—searched the streets of the **[Market Ward](https://mimir.net/collections/brixs-guide-to-the-market-ward/)** for an artificer skilled in magical construct repair. She found, sitting on a rug between two stalls, a handsome, dark skinned half-elf who claimed to be both a barber and a specialist with clockworks.

His name was **Shafi Bin Ahmad Zin** _(prime half-elf wizard/rogue [he/him] / **[Fated](https://mimir.net/the.chant.on/fated/)** / NG)_. He wore a white cotton turban, sandals, and an elegant silken robe of golds and white. Accompanying him on what looked like a magical rug was a tiny green-blue woman and a small construct resembling a flying monodrone modron. Also on the rug were tools for repair (or possibly for picks for theft), bowls, combs, razors and scissors for grooming customers.

The conversation between Shafi and the mimir’s former owner was exhausting, as the dusky half-elf was long-winded indeed. The mimir was unable to record the exchange until its dents were repaired, at which point it was able to record the following monologue:

**“**…Nirvana? No, good woman, no such plane exists! You may be thinking of **[Mechanus](https://mimir.net/layers/mechanus/mechanus/)**, which fits your description. Yes, I was there in search of spiritual perfection, but found that their brand of perfection did not suit me. Some would say it is an insightful plane, but those who speak such nonsense are mainly the **[Guvners](https://mimir.net/culture/factions/fraternity-of-order/)**. I found more perfection in the Inner Planes, but that is another story to be told at another time.

**“**If you do go there, my sweet date-palm, be prepared for one of the most alien of planes. I survived by watching and aping the ways of its inhabitants, and by strictly following their laws. This my is free planewalking advice to you, oh Maiden Who Rivals the Beauty of Devas.

**“**I came upon many new spells for my **gen** to fetch at a later time, most of which reflected the nature of Mechanus. Most are specific to that plane, but some can be adapted for use anywhere in the multiverse. One can even put common spells to good use, by either reversing their effect or casting in the right place at the right time. Here are a few I ‘borrowed’ from the natives of Mechanus:

- **Tick-Tock:** This spell intensifies the sounds made by the gears of Mechanus, pacifying modrons and the like but driving non-lawful creatures barmy
- **Cogstorm:** This summons a swirling swarm of small cogs, which strike those within the storm’s area with great force
- **Contact Gear Spirit:** This spell allows a diviner to determine the workings of any machinery in question, or to navigate their way through the Labyrinthine Portal
- **De-Grease:** This is a simple reversal of the _grease_ spell, which creates a horrible racket when cast on the oiled gears of Mechanus
- **Find Pi:** This spell forces a creature to obsess over the mathematical value of pi, usually immobilising the poor soul

“I can tell you much more, but I see you have to go, Shining Lady of the Glittering Sands. Don’t forget that the plane is your resource if you can master it. For example, I found that the spare, tiny cogs laying about Mechanus, much like pebbles in the wastes, made effective sling missiles. They seemed to do damage equal to that of a sling bullet, and could even injure hierarch modrons. Gather those stray cogs and throw them behind you when pursued, and it can effectively slow those that follow in the manner of caltrops. You must go so soon? Good day, Brilliant Butterfly Who Graces the Desert Flowers of Spring! Please come again to grace my presence with your unrivalled beauty!”

#### **The Dark**

Shafi is from **Zakhara**, the Land of Fate. Although he belongs to the faction with the namesake of his prime land, his affiliation as a namer is loose at best. It is his belief that the **Hand of Fate** can be guided to suit his needs, but he has had his moments of charity. He makes an honourable living repairing clockwork, dispensing information and grooming bloods of all races in the **Great Bazaar**.

The balsa and copper construct always seen near Shafi is one of his clockwork creations, modelled after a monodrone modron. It is capable of clumsy flight (FL 6, hp 6) and can fetch things for him in much the same manner as an _unseen servant_ spell would. Unbeknownst to Shafi, while he visited Mechanus a rouge gear spirit housed itself within the gears of the clockwork servant. The gear spirit’s intent to was to stowaway from the tyrannic order of Mechanus under the guise of the clockwork, and no one seems to be the wiser. Now the clockwork also has the abilities of the gear spirit, and has lately shown a will of its own.

Shafi is highly intelligent and terribly charismatic. His lithe fingers are at ease repairing the most minute construct, and he can deftly groom and style anything from a **Barnstable** halfling’s furry feet to an **erinyes’** coiffure. Since he has chatted while grooming almost anything with horns, nails, hair or hide, Shafi is an excellent font of information, both correct and misleading. His prices for grooming, basic medicinal tasks, clockwork repair or planar knowledge are reasonable by Market Ward standards.

## About Emberheart Core

> _"Ahh, the **Infernal Iron Clasp**—yes, yes, that part I know well. You’ll need a **hinge that does not melt**, a **bite that holds steady even when the heart forgets to beat**. Infernal iron, yes, from the forges of Dis, or better yet, pulled from the hauberk of a fallen Hellknight still smoldering on the banks of the Styx. I _do_ know a broker, a cautious sort with horns too polished for his own good. But mark me, sweet candle-flame, it will cost more than coin. You’ll need to trade in _promise_, in _principle_—and those don’t grow on trees in Sigil."_

> _"Of course, you might always go fetch it yourself, bold as a balor’s laugh. Walk the charred streets of **Dis**, hold your breath near the **Pain-Furnaces**, or, gods help you, **scavenge after a Blood War skirmish**, when the smoke has yet to clear and the screaming still echoes. Dangerous, yes—but cheap, if you value risk over gold."_

> _"Now, the **Flesh-Affinity Thread**—an exquisite rarity, but possible. It must come from a creature whose body burns **without perishing**, a thing whose _sinew remembers fire_ better than it does pain. A **fire-spider** from Ysgard’s burning fields—yes, I’ve seen one once, scampering through coals like a poet through heartbreak. Or… for those with darker appetites, you might extract it from the glands of a **phase-thread parasite** from Carceri, but you’d need gloves **woven from lies** just to hold the thing."_

> _"I could help spin it, once obtained, of course. But the harvesting? Oh no, no, no, that’s far outside the comfort of my rug."_

> _(His smile fades, for just a flicker.)_  
> _"Now… the third item. The one you truly need. The scalpel. The one that **cuts the truth** from flesh."_  
> _"I’m afraid I cannot help you there, Brilliant Spark of the Ash-Sky. That tool lies **beyond my repertoire and moral tolerance**. I've heard only whispers. Mutters behind closed stalls. Rumors of a place, a **collective**, that deals in what they call _‘resculpting the soul’._"_

> _"They’re not healers. Nor are they scientists, not truly. **They are graft-thieves**, flesh-hackers, rogue surgeons who carve up the living to see what grows in the cracks. I've heard they operate beneath the Skin Market, maybe even deeper—**a place without names, only bargains.** They take in the desperate, the devout, and the damned."_

> _"Find them, and perhaps they can carve the **socket for your flame.** But beware, once your chest is open to them, they may not stop at the heart."_
