The pipeline implements a three-stage architecture for explainable AI validation:
1. **xAI Processing:** Domain appropriate **xAI techniques** (SHAP, LIME, Grad-CAM, or DALEX, etc) extract feature attributions from the target model. Outputs are structured into standardizes JSON payloads counting: feature importance scores, prediction confidence intervals, instance-level contribution mapping. 
2. **Narrative Generator:** A fine-tuned **Narrator LLM** transforms structured xAI outputs into domain-specific natural language explanations. The narrator model incorporates domain specific lexicons, context-aware templating and regulatory compliant phrasing constraints with LoRA adapters and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT).
3. **Automated Validation:** The **Judge LLM** leverages DeepEval's *GEval* with rule-based validation modules against configurable quality pillars. These contain the contextual accuracy (cross-verification against knowledge bases), operational safety (hazard phrase detection and tone analysis) and actionability (required element extraction).

These metrics undergo threshold comparison (e.g., pass >= 0.8), with failures triggering safety mechanisms and messages via feedback-loop optimization, enabling continuous integration within MLOps workflows.
