# Skippy
#### *Weapon (Firearm - Light Pistol), Uncommon*  

| ![[Skippy.webp]] | *A small, custom-built smartgun that looks like it was cobbled together by someone with equal parts ingenuity and questionable decision-making. The frame is a mix of reclaimed metal plating and jury-rigged components, painted in garish yellow and red, with the name "Skippy" haphazardly scrawled on the side. The top housing contains a rudimentary targeting system, though it's clearly prone to malfunctions.*<br> |

## Effects & Abilities  

### Smart-Aim System (HUD)
Skippy subtly assists with aiming, granting **+1 to attack rolls.** 

> "Calculating trajectory... Boom! Right in the bread basket!"

### Adaptive Ammunition
Skippy's smart chamber allows it to fire a variety of **specialized bullets**, adapting its damage type to the loaded ammo.

- Standard rounds (1d10 piercing)
- AP bullets (1d10 poison damage) - 6 rounds remaining

> "Ooh, spicy rounds! Someone's getting a bad case of the dead!"

### **Personality Mode Selection**

Choose your preferred targeting protocol (this choice is PERMANENT... probably):

- **Stone Cold Killer**: Aims exclusively for lethal shots. +2d6 damage on hits, but -2 to attack rolls against prone or Small creatures. 
	> "Headshots only, choom! Maximum fatality!"
- **Puppy-Loving Pacifist**: Targets non-vital areas. Hits reduce enemy speed by 10 ft, advantage on attempts to disarm. 
	> "Kneecaps are temporary, but trauma is forever!"

### **Chatty Combat Assistant**

- Skippy provides running commentary during combat, occasionally revealing useful information
> "Hey! That guy's favoring his left side! Also, his mother would be disappointed in his life choices!"

### **Unstable Misfire**

    1. Skippy plays embarrassing music loudly for 1 minute (_"This one's called 'My Heart Will Go On'!"_)
    2. Shoots confetti instead (no damage, target is surprised) (_"SURPRISE! It's not your birthday but you're still getting a party!"_)
    3. Skippy goes on strike for 1d4 rounds (_"I need a mental health day! You people are exhausting!"_)
    4. Bullet ricochets comically, roll random target (_"Physics is more of an art than a science!"_)
