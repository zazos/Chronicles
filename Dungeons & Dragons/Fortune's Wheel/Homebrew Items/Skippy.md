# Skippy
#### *Weapon (Firearm - Light Pistol), Uncommon*  

| ![[Skippy.webp]] | *A small, custom-built smartgun that looks like it was cobbled together by someone with equal parts ingenuity and questionable decision-making. The frame is a mix of reclaimed metal plating and jury-rigged components, painted in garish yellow and red, with the name "Skippy" haphazardly scrawled on the side. The top housing contains a rudimentary targeting system, though it's clearly prone to malfunctions.*<br> |
