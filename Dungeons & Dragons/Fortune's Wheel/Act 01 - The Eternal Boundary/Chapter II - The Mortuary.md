### Funeral Dirge

This encounter takes place if the player characters openly approach the Dustmen to question them on Eliath's whereabouts. If they try to sneak or bluff their way into the Mortuary instead, use the detailed description of the Mortuary later in this chapter to handle the ploy.

*The Mortuary stands in a hopeless area of the Hive. It's ringed by the slums of Sigil's Unclean — those people who do work that others won't touch. The Mortuary's surroundings are almost safe, since the people here tend to be honest despite their wretched circumstances. Small alehouses, tanneries, and slaughterhouses fill the area. A fair amount of commerce surrounds the Mortuary. You meet a number of unclean ones going about their business; children following them, begging for a few coins. The hustle and bustle comes to a complete stop on the Mortuary's side of the street. Not a soul is in sight. One black, somber gate leads into the jagged edifice of dark stone. The Mortuary is a collection of dilapidated mausoleums, piled together with no organization. Inside the gate, you are halted by a squad of six Dustmen guards, dressed in black. "What's your business here?" asks one. "Who've you come to bury? All of you are still on your feet."*

If the PCs explain their true mission, the leader of the guards says, "Speak to Toranna. She's in charge of interring any nameless sods who're brought in. I'll send for her. If your barmy Eliath came in recently, she'll know."

[[Toranna| Toranna]] shows up a few minutes later and invites the party to look around while she answers their questions. She remembers seeing Eliath brought in about a week ago and doesn't hesitate to tell the party so. "When we don't know where to send someone who's passed on, we incinerate them in the Elemental Plane of Fire," she says. "Most barmies and bubbers fall in that category. Your friend Eliath was sent to the flames last week."

Read the following when they enter the [[Portal to Plane of Fire.webp||chamber]]:

*A vast, dimly lit chamber deep, with walls lined with aged stone bricks covered in soot and ash. The room is filled with the somber sounds of grim workers shrouded in dark, tattered robes, their faces obscured by hoods. They methodically carry lifeless bodies on wooden stretchers, their footsteps echoing across the cold stone floor. At the far end of the chamber, a large, ominous portal crackles with bright orange and red flames, flickering and roaring as if hungry for more. This portal is a gateway to the Elemental Plane of Fire, its edges shimmering with intense heat, distorting the air around it. As each body is unceremoniously thrown into the portal, the flames momentarily surge and then settle, as if the portal itself consumes the remains. The chamber is filled with an oppressive heat, and the scent of burning flesh lingers in the air. The workers move in a steady, unwavering rhythm, their task never-ending in this eerie place where the dead are fed to the eternal flames.*

Toranna shows the PCs the portal if they want to see for themselves. There's  
not too much else she can tell them. If the PCs are insistent, she suggests that  
they could go to the plane of Fire to have a look for themselves. Once the PCs  
leave, Toranna notifies the Shadowknave that the party is asking after barmies that he sent  
to her. Run "A Shadow in Sigil" within the next day or so.

### A Help in Need

Derioch informs the character's about Eliath's whereabouts:
- *"Doomguard's got Eliath. One of my cutters saw him down at the Fire Pit in the Lower Ward, wearing their colors. Guess he wasn't so barmy after all."*
- (If told Eliath is dead): *"Dead, huh? Maybe. Or maybe they just want you to think that. The Doomguard and Dustmen? They're tight. Wouldn't be the first time someone 'died' to disappear."*
- (If the PCs need to travel to the Elemental Plane of Fire) *"If you're really going through with this fire-dancing scheme, you'll need gear. Potions, fire resistance, invisibility. Market Ward's got what you need. Find a seller you trust, or at least one who won't gut your purse."*

If the PCs mention the deaths in the Hive or the Shadowknave:
- *"Ahh, so our Knave's got sticky fingers in this mess? Figures. Bastard always did have a taste for blood, so long as it wasn't his own."*
- *"If the Knave's involved, that means money's changing hands. And if money's changing hands, that means somebody wants these sods dead."*

Some things about the Mortuary and the Dustmen:
- *"You've seen the Mortuary up close. Looks like a tomb, smells like a tomb. But the worst part is that, if you listen close, you can still hear whispers in there, half dead voices, calling from behind the gates."*
- *"The Dustmen don't just send bodies through portals 'cause they like efficiency. Some of those portals go to places worse than death."*
- *"And you know what's worse than dying in the Hive? Not even leaving a body behind. You just get erased, like you were never here at all."*


### The [[Fire Pit]]

[[Eliath (masked).webp||Eliath]] and his fellow Doomguards want to be left alone and resent intrusions. However, they've got no reason to be suspicious of the PCs. As long as the PCs are civil, the Doomguards answer most questions. However, the instant a PC blurts out anything sounding like an accusation, the Doomguards leap to their feet and draw their swords, ready to punish the party for their ill-considered words.

If the PCs wait until the Doomguards leave and then follow them, the other party of Doomguards follows the PCs. The Doomguards are very wary of anyone approaching them on the street, but if the PCs remember their manners, they won't have any trouble. If the PCs settle for trailing Eliath, the second group of Doomguards jumps them, figuring that the PCs are up to no good.

If the PCs wait for Eliath to return from the Armory, they can isolate him without the Doomguards around for support. Eliath can then be questioned more directly and is a bit intimidated by the party.


## Eliath's Chant

*As you approach, Eliath, now a robed and armored figure among the Doomguard, watches them with a measured gaze. His demeanor is composed, his movements precise. There is no trace of madness in his sharp, clear eyes—only **conviction.** When he speaks, his voice is steady, almost reverent.*

*"Greetings, travelers. You look surprised to see me? 
Aye, I arrived in Sigil three weeks past. Fortune favored me—I was taken in by these Doomguard here. There's wisdom in their words, you know. The multiverse trends toward dissolution, and that is the way of things. 
I understand that now. I won’t be going back to Toril—what’s left for me there?"*

If the PCs press him about inconsistencies in his story, he doesn’t waver. The Doomguard confirm his story, reinforcing it. But if he is cornered when they are absent, and the PCs present undeniable evidence, Eliath falters. His expression darkens, his fingers flex nervously.

*"…Alright. You've found me out. You **know** what I was before, what I have left behind. But listen—**I am Eliath no longer.***

*"I was once a wizard of Toril, aye. Came here some fifteen years past. Three years ago, I read something I shouldn't have. A book in the city's library, words written by a mind not meant to be understood by mortals. The knowledge… it hollowed me out. Shattered me. I became just another nameless madman in the Hive, a beggar clinging to scraps of reality, lost in the tide of my own mind. I died alone, not knowing my name, not knowing where I was.*

*"But then… I crossed the **Boundary**. And there, I saw him—**Jergal, the Final Scribe**. The ancient one, the keeper of the Ledger of Ends. He showed me the truth. He told me that life is only preparation for entropy, and that I had wasted mine in madness and fear. That even my death had been meaningless.*

*"'But,' he said, 'you have one last entry to make in your story. The end is yet unfinished. Return. Join the Doomguard. Embrace entropy, and in doing so, you will serve my purpose. Learn the fate of all things, and understand the beauty in the crumbling of empires, the fading of stars, the rusting of steel.'*

*"And then… I awoke, gasping, in the Lower Ward. And for the first time in years, my mind was clear."*

_(His gaze sharpens as he leans forward, gripping his belt, his knuckles white.)_

*"I have been given one last chance—and I will not waste it. This is my path now, and I will walk it to the end. Tell me, cutters—would you deny a dead man his final purpose?"*

### Further pressure

- If the PCs push thinking he's "brainwashed", Eliath scoffs.
	- *"You think me enchanted? No. I have never seen the world more clearly. Before, I was mad.** Now, I see. The Doomguard understand—everything is **meant** to fade, to fall. It is in that collapse that we find truth."*
- If the PCs try to remind him of his past life:
	- *"You do not understand. My past? It was wasted. I died a fool. This life is my only true one. The rest was meaningless."*
- If the PCs threaten his new place in the Doomguard:
	- *His composure finally cracks. His hand drifts to a dagger at his belt. His voice is lower, colder*.
		- *"If you take this from me… if you undo what has been done… then you condemn me to meaninglessness again. I will not return to the dark. I would rather die twice than have that fate forced on me."*

### How he views death

*Eliath exhales, watching the crumbling facade of a nearby building as if it is a beautiful thing.*

*"Death is not an end. It is only the next step toward entropy. I have seen what lies beyond, and I understand now—it is not to be feared. It is to be embraced. That which is built will fall. That which lives will die. And yet… I have been given a final chance to see it all unfold."*

### To be an Entropist

*He places a hand over his chest, fingers curling over the symbol of the Doomguard.*

*"They know the truth. They do not fight the end; they embrace it. Some seek to accelerate it, others only to understand it. But all know this: Entropy is not to be mourned. It is to be welcomed.*

*"And so, I serve them, and through them, I serve Jergal. I will not waste this chance."*


## The Dancing Man Returns

The PCs meet the Dancing Man again, but he's not half as barmy as they thought he was.

*While passing through a busy marketplace, you see a familiar figure, the Dancing Man — his bony frame and flaming red hair are unmistakable. The sight of the him is quite a shock. He's striding down the center of the street with a strong step, his eyes clear and sane, his waistcoat replaced by gleaming chain mail and polished black boots. The Dancing Man's in the colors of one of (random faction). Whistling tunelessly between his teeth, he nods a friendly greeting and keeps going*

"Well met, cutter! You got the look of folk who’ve been around, eh? You should know, there's no finer feeling than walking these streets with a fresh wind in your lungs, no past to weigh you down, and a song at your lips! Ahh, Sigil—it smells different, sharper, sweeter. The drinks are stronger, the music richer, and by the gods, the company is finer. Hah!"

If asked about his past, he’ll be casual, as if recounting an old story that no longer quite belongs to him.

*"Oh, you must be mistaking me for someone else—Dancing Man? Sounds like a colorful fellow, but that ain't me. No, I'm **Tylaric Stormwing**, traveler, joy-seeker, and devoted servant of Sune! He gave me a second chance, you see. Said the first time around, I was doing it all wrong—wasting my days on madness instead of bliss. He plucked me from the dark and showed me the real trick to existence: living it."*


### Further pressure

If Tylaric is confronted with an accusation about his origin:
*Tylaric's eyes flicker with momentary discomfort before he laughs it off, waving his hands dramatically.*

*"Oh, aye. I was dead! D-E-A-D. Heart stopped, breath left, the whole corpse-and-cobblestones bit. And you know what I remember of it? Not much, till the grand moment—when I found myself before **the Feast Eternal.** Wine flowed, laughter rang, music swelled! A voice, warm as the first sip of fine brandy, said, ‘You, my wayward soul, have one more round in you yet. Go forth, taste, touch, sing, dance—this is your charge!’ And next thing I knew, I was breathing again, standing in Sigil, feeling the sun on my face like it was the first time."*

*"Ω, ναι. Ήμουν νεκρός! D-E-A-D. Η καρδιά σταμάτησε, η αναπνοή έφυγε, όλο αυτό με το πτώμα και τα λιθόστρωτα. Και ξέρεις τι θυμάμαι από αυτό; Όχι πολλά, μέχρι τη μεγάλη στιγμή - όταν βρέθηκα μπροστά στην **αιώνια γιορτή.** Το κρασί έρεε, το γέλιο χτυπούσε, η μουσική χτυπούσε! Μια φωνή, ζεστή σαν την πρώτη γουλιά εκλεκτού κονιάκ, είπε: "Εσύ, δύστροπη ψυχή μου, έχεις ακόμα έναν γύρο μέσα σου. Βγες έξω, δοκίμασε, άγγιξε, τραγούδησε, χόρεψε - αυτή είναι η αποστολή σου! Και το επόμενο πράγμα που κατάλαβα ήταν ότι ανέπνεα ξανά, στεκόμουν στο Σίγκιλ, νιώθοντας τον ήλιο στο πρόσωπό μου σαν να ήταν η πρώτη φορά. "*

_(He leans in conspiratorially, dropping his voice to a whisper.)_

*"They tell me I was barmy once. Maybe I was, but does it really matter? I have my second chance, and I’ll not waste it brooding over ghosts of a life I can’t recall. Now, tell me, cutters—have you ever drunk the spiced nectar from the dreamfruit of Bytopia? No? Ahh, then you’ve not yet lived! Come, I know a place!"*

*"Μου λένε ότι κάποτε ήμουν τρελός. Ίσως ήμουν, αλλά έχει σημασία; Έχω τη δεύτερη ευκαιρία μου, και δεν θα τη χαραμίσω με το να μελαγχολώ για τα φαντάσματα μιας ζωής που δεν μπορώ να θυμηθώ. Τώρα, πείτε μου, κόφτες - έχετε πιει ποτέ το καρυκευμένο νέκταρ από το φρούτο των ονείρων της Μυτοπίας; Όχι; Τότε δεν έχετε ζήσει ακόμα! Ελάτε, ξέρω ένα μέρος!" *

### How he views death

_(He shrugs, stretching his arms as if shaking off an old coat.)_

*"Θάνατος; Pah! Μια πόρτα, τίποτα περισσότερο. Την πέρασα μια φορά και γύρισα καλύτερος άνθρωπος. Έτσι, αν οι θεοί έχουν σχέδια για μένα ακόμα, θα σηκώσω ένα ποτήρι στο όνομά τους και θα περπατήσω όποιο δρόμο μου ορίσουν! Είτε ζήσω έναν αιώνα είτε μια μέρα, όλα είναι μέρος του χορού, κόφτη. Και δεν θα σταματήσω ποτέ να χορεύω."

### To be a Sensate

_(Gesturing proudly to his fine garments, symbols of the Sensates embroidered in gold thread.)_

*"Οι Sensates, βλέπετε, ξέρουν τι είναι τι. Η ζωή δεν είναι μόνο επιβίωση, αλλά και εμπειρία. Τι νόημα έχει να είσαι ζωντανός αν δεν ξέρεις τη γεύση χιλίων κρασιών, την αίσθηση μεταξιού από εκατό κόσμους, τον ήχο της μουσικής που παίζεται στις καλύτερες ουράνιες άρπες; Εδώ είμαι λοιπόν, κάνοντας το σωστό αυτή τη φορά, βιώνοντας τα πάντα. Ίσως κάποια μέρα συναντήσω την κατάλληλη ψυχή, μοιραστώ μερικές ιστορίες και πιω βαθιά κάθε απόλαυση που προσφέρει αυτό το πολυσύμπαν. Αυτό, φίλοι μου, είναι αυτό που ονομάζω ζωή." *

### The Mortuary

The encounters in this chapter should lead the PCs to the [[The Mortuary Structure|The Mortuary]]. Clearly, something unusual is happening to the supposedly dead barmies who are being sent through the portal to the Elemental Plane of Fire.
**DM NOTE**: By now, the players have several clues. They know that barmies have died, been interred at the Mortuary, and then returned. The facts should point to one of two explanations: either the Dustmen are lying about what happens to the barmies who are taken to the Mortuary, or some- one is using the Dustmen for their own purposes. If the players are off track, encourage them to compare notes and discuss things. Provide the party with more obvious hints if necessary.
