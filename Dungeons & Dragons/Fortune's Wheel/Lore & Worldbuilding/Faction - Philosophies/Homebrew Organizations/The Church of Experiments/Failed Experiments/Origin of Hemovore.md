## Project Hemovore: Bloodborne Evolution

> *"Undeath is a shortcut, not a solution. The Church does not tolerate regression.*

This program predates Project V-HELOX and was the Church's  first serious effort at cheating death. Spearheaded by the [[The Master.png]] in his early tenure, Project Hemovore aimed to create a form of immortality that fused the regenerative properties of vampirism with artificial control mechanisms.

The Church believed it could:
- Harness vampiric hunger as a metaphysical engine.
- Modify the need for blood into **etheric fuel**, powering biomechanical augmentation.
- Induce immortality without spiritual undeath.

### Initial Outcomes:

- Subjects exhibited extreme regenerative capacity.
- However, hunger could not be transmuted—it became _worse_.  The afflicted became **Hemovores**: synthetic vampires addicted not just to blood, but to **living data**—memories, emotions, identities.
	- One of the very few alive Hemovores is [[Crucemir, the first Hemovore]]

The Church purged the labs. The Master resisted.  
He believed he was close. He was exiled. And in exile, he turned to necromancy.
