Dear Daniel,

I wanted to share with you an exciting use-case that we have developed in collaboration with our maritime partner Laskaridis for empowerAI.
Our joint discussions have led to a comprehensive vision aimed at leveraging Federated Learning and AI for transformative impact across maritime fleets.

The core idea is to deploy AI models directly on vessels, enabling each ship to analyze its sensor data and operational logs locally. Insights, never raw data, are securely shared across a secure federation, allowing the collective intelligence of the entire fleet (~100 ships) to improve each vessel's performance and maintenance scheduling. 

Some key features:
- Real time performance (degradation) monitoring of vessel efficiency (The Green PdM)
	- Using a time-series model for Predictive Maintenance (PdM)
- AI Co-Sailor: Fleet-wide recommendation via a privacy preserving Federated Maritime Large Language Model (FM-LLM)
	- Interprets both sensor data and unstructured logs to generate actionable, explainable guidance (like a narrator)
	- E.g. how to improve CII (Carbon Intensity Indicator) ratings, pinpoint causes of inefficiency, recommend optimal maintenance windows, etc.
	- Taking pre-trained LLM and fine-tune them.
- No raw data leaves the ships, only anonymized model updates
- A system that gets smarter as more vessels join, ticking the boxes of scalability and robustness

Some possible KPIs:
- Targeted reduction of fuel consumption by 5-8% fleet-wide
- Improved environmental and financial performance (link to CII ratings)
- Enhanced decision-making speed and reliability through conversational AI
- Shift of scheduled maintenance from fixed intervals to evidence-based triggers

We would like to express the intention of NKUA to lead the design and orchestration of the federated learning architecture for this initiative. Our team brings substantial expertise in this area, with significant experience in the application of the Flower framework to large-scale, privacy-preserving federated learning systems

Furthermore, our partner Laskaridis stands ready to support the deployment of pilot implementations, offering access to real fleet data for validation and demonstration purposes.

Please find attached a draft version of the use-case notes for your review. As I will be on vacation leave next week, I would be pleased to present this proposal to the consortium on July 29th.

Should you have any questions or require further clarifications in the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact me!

Best,
Panagiotis (and Panos)
