![[Bob the Blob.webp]]

When Bob the Blob was recovered from the Ditch near the Hive Ward, the morticians were shocked to discover that Bob was not just another discarded experiment but had miraculously returned as an intelligent undead. His body, grotesque and abominable in life, somehow retained its childlike mind and good nature in undeath, but with a new sense of peace and purpose, aligning him with the Dustmen's ideology.

After his recover, Bob found a purpose working in the Mortuary, performing menial tasks like carrying bodies or preparing the dead for their final rest. His gentle demeanour made him surprisingly well-suited for this, as the Dustmen value his unique combination of intelligence, strength, and philosophical alignment.

Bob’s nature as an undead, especially one who was once a grotesque experiment, aligns with the Dustmen's view that life is an illusion, and only through embracing death can one achieve transcendence. Bob seems to have found a peaceful acceptance of his fate, which has deeply impressed some Dustmen members, particularly the Factol or other high-ranking figures.

Bob has also embraced his new existence as an undead, which means that while he still remembers his past fondly, he may no longer be the same carefree Blob he once was.


### Dustmen - Church of Experiments

This plotline introduces significant tension between two powerful factions in Sigil: the Dustmen and the Church of Experiments. While the Dustmen believe in accepting death as the natural state of being, the Church of Experiments views death as a challenge to overcome through mechanical and alchemical means.

Dustmen's Motives:
- **Philosophical Opposition**: The Dustmen, who oppose any form of unnatural undeath like lichdom, would naturally be opposed to the Master’s plan to become a Necromaton, viewing it as an abomination—a blasphemous rejection of death. The Necromaton is the antithesis of what the Dustmen stand for, as it seeks immortality through the fusion of machine and necromancy, a clear defiance of the natural cycle of life and death.
- **The Deal**: The Factol of the Dustmen (or a high-ranking Dustman) may have struck a secret deal with the Church of Experiments to keep Bob in the Mortuary, either to keep Bob’s existence hidden or because the Church fears the Dustmen’s political influence and has no desire to provoke them. In exchange, the Dustmen agree to remain silent about the Church’s activities and refrain from interfering directly with their experiments.
- **Leverage**: The Dustmen’s silence might be a strategic move. By keeping Bob in their care, the Dustmen may also be keeping tabs on the Church’s experiments, knowing that Bob’s existence is proof of the Church’s hubris. If the Church opposes them, the Dustmen could reveal Bob’s origins, triggering a potential backlash or faction war.

Moreover, the Church, despite its scientific arrogance, is wary of openly opposing the Dustmen. They recognize that any direct conflict with the Dustmen would require tremendous resources, as the Dustmen are deeply entrenched in Sigil’s political landscape and have a large following. Furthermore, the Dustmen’s ties to death give them access to dangerous necromantic magic, something the Church would rather avoid confronting. And while the Church seeks to transcend death through the creation of  Necromatons, they also understand that the Dustmen represent a faction they cannot easily undermine. The Church may view the Dustmen as religious fanatics clinging to old ideas of death, but they are aware that any open defiance could cripple their operations in Sigil.
