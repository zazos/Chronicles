Since the terrain in the **[Outlands](https://mimir.net/layers/outlands/outlands/)** is always on the move, some enterprising (and powerful) cutters like to take their strongholds with them. Some are powered by the innovative mechanics of gnomes, others by powerful magic or godly boon. Of course, the owners of magical castles have to be careful they don’t accidentally cross the sixth ring into a anti-magic part of the Outlands that’ll dead-book a walking castle quicker than you can say a tanar’ri tongue-twister. The mechanical ones can walk where they like, although they’re more prone to breaking down, of course.

The huge trampling feet of walking castles cause all manner of damage to local wildlife and terrain, but most castles stay away from built-up areas—the point of owning a walking castle is to stay away from other cutters, mostly.

Walking castles vary in size and the materials they’re built from. They range from small huts with chicken legs, to taverns with spider legs, to sprawling castles on mechanical stilts, and hilltop forts which are actually built on walking tortoise-bodies.

Walking castles are one of the best ways to defend yourself from Outlands bandits, but some of the more militant groups would love to get their hands on an easily-defensible stronghold.
