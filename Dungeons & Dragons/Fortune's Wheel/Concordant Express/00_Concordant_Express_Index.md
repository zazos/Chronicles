## Adventure Overview

The **Concordant Express** is a luxurious planar train that travels the Great Road across the Outlands, connecting various gate-towns to Automata (gateway to Mechanus). This particular journey carries a very special prisoner: **[[Keth Ravencrest - The Stranger (Statblock)|The Stranger]]**, a member of the Hands of Havoc captured during a recent anarchist action against the Harmonium in Sigil.

### The Stakes

**[[Keth Ravencrest - The Stranger (Statblock)|The Stranger]]** possesses dangerous knowledge—the True Names of several prominent yugoloths, including some of Shemeshka's associates. If this information reaches Automata's courts, it could destabilize delicate power balances across the Lower Planes. If it falls into Shemeshka's hands, she gains unprecedented leverage over her yugoloth contacts.

### The Three Factions

**1. [[Hands of Havoc|Hands of Havoc]] (The Heroes' Allies)**
- **Leader:** [[Adia Panamaa.webp|Adia Panama]] (operating through agents)
- **Objective:** Rescue The Stranger before reaching Automata
- **Resources:** Train tickets for the party, inside information about the car layout

**2. Shemeshka's Task Force - "The Gilded Claws"**
- **Leader:** Vex "Golden Tongue" Maraleth
- **Primary Objective:** Capture The Stranger alive for interrogation
- **Secondary Objective:** If capture impossible, eliminate The Stranger completely

**3. Ignatius Inkblot (Wild Card)**
- **Objective:** Investigate Shemeshka's involvement and gather intelligence
- **Alliance:** Neutral—could aid against Shemeshka but opposes freeing dangerous knowledge

### Timeline Pressure

The journey to Automata takes **8 hours**. The party must locate The Stranger (Car E8, heavily guarded), navigate increasing security awareness, deal with Shemeshka's infiltration attempt, and execute their rescue before arriving at Automata's impregnable station.
