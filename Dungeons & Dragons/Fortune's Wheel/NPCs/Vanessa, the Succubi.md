> Every night, she haunts my dreams,
> I see her there before me,
> her slender hands, like whispers cold
> are reaching out to clutch my very soul.
>
> I close my eyes, yet I still see,
> Her visage etched in memory,
> Eyes of fire, smouldering bright,
> Burning through the veil of night.
> 
> Wings of shadow, dark and wide,
> Cloak her form where secrets hide,
> Tresses black as the Abyss,
> Lips like blood, a fatal kiss.
> 
> When she beckons, I shan't resist,
> For in her grasp, I find bliss,
> Though I know her kiss brings doom,
> I shall meet her in the gloom.
> 
> I will walk into her embrace,
> Forsaking all but her dark grace,
> And as I step from dream to death,
> She shall claim my final breath.
> 
> Into the void where shadows creep,
> Where all is lost, and none may weep,
> In silence deep, devoid of light,
> I shall be hers, eternal night.
