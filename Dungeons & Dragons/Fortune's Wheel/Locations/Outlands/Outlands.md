*Also known as — (by Planewalkers) The Land; (by Primes) Concordant Opposition*


The Outlands border all the other planes of the Great Ring, touches the Astral and has Sigil, the City of Doors floating above its heart.

More is known about the Outlands than many other planes put together, but there are also a great many mysteries to be encountered here. Not least is the **[Spire](https://mimir.net/places/the-spire/)** itself, an infinitely tall tapering pillar of dark rock that rises from the flat plains of the Outlands both suddenly and with eyewatering proportions.

The Outlands themselves can be divided into three portions: The Spire, the Gate Towns, and the Hinterlands. The first of these applies to the vast area, called “the Disc” by some locals, and the Spirelands by others, radiating out from the Spire. It’s here that staunchly neutral communities make their kips, bloods who choose not to choose radical beliefs dwell, and the rilmani, that mysterious grey race of the Outlands, hold sway. It’s also the largest magic-dead area in the Multiverse, for the Spire apparently draws all magic into itself. The closer you are to the Spire, the more the arcane weave is affected. This effect weakens as you walk with your back to the Spire towards the second part of the plane. Near the Spire, even the powers lose the ability to use magic, which means it’s a good place for them to meet and parlay but it’s a rare god who will put themselves in this position.

Further out from the **Spirelands**, a planewalker will come to the Ringlands. Here you’ll find a cluster of divine lands where many powers have combined their efforts to create giant shared realms. Tir na Og is the home of the Celtic Tuatha de Dannan, the Dwarven Mountain of three of the Morndinsamman, and the Marketplace Eternal of the alliance of mercantile powers.

Clinging to the brink of the Outlands are the **Gate Towns**, burgs that perch on the precipice of belief between neutrality and some other philosophy. There’s one for each of the Outer Planes, (that’s sixteen in all, berk), and all have permanent gates to their respective planes within their walls. The area surrounding the ring of gate towns is generally called the **Brinklands**.

Beyond the ring of gate towns lie the untold mysteries of the **Hinterlands**. Nobody really knows for sure what they contain, for they have a nasty habit of never being the same twice. Thing is, it’s not the churning chaos of Limbo, or the ever-moving revolving discs of Mechanus; the landscape appears perfectly normal. Well—normal for the planes, that is. You could walk for years and never see the same thing twice, they say. But turn around, and within an hour or two you’re right back where you started again. Travellers have told tales of waking in a different place to where they fell asleep, or of cities there that change shape and location hourly. But they also tell of lost civilisations, uncountable riches, and weird creatures called **the Strangers** who have taken the concept of balance to extremes. Maybe that’s why people go out there—and why they get lost there…


### Travel in the Outlands

The Outlands is infinite in size and changes constantly. This makes the distances between locations and the time it takes to get from place to place
variable. How long travel takes is up to you—it could take 3d6 days to get from one gate-town to the next closest one, or weeks, or longer. While traveling
in the walking castle, the characters are safe, and encounters occur only when you choose.
