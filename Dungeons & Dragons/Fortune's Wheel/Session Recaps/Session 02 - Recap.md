[[Adia Panamaa.webp||Adia Panama]] is accustomed with [[Clarion the Guardian||Clarion's]] network and activities. The tiefling swore that she has seen the PCs before but couldn't remember exactly how or when. The safest suspicion was to connect the sudden deaths and reappearances of barmies in the Hive with what might have happened to the PCs. 

In Session 2, the PCs tried to sneak in Adia's basement, their suspicion got the hold of them. She caught them sneaking it and due to her busy schedule and their embarrassment, she didn't quite threatened them, but politely asked them to leave the establishment. After the [[Through Hell and Back||incident in the Market Ward]], two ogres that were part of the product transport company whispered to one of the PCs that Adia wants to see them. 
The tiefling took the risk and trusted her gut (sensing the rebellious spirit of [[Rubicon]]) in inviting the PCs into her hideout, which was a [[Hands of Havoc]] hideout.
She gave them a brief explanation of Sigil's factions conflicts.
The PCs accepted a rather difficult quest, to free one important member of the Hands of Havoc that was being transported to Mechanus for his trial. The adventure that consists the escape of that man is being covered in [[Affair on the Concordant Express]] that will take place later in the story. As of now, Adia is trying to get her hands on some tickets for the Concordant Express, which are rather difficult to obtain. 

The PCs are headed towards the Hive, getting settler in [[Fiend's Salute Tavern]], meeting [[Clarion the Guardian]].
