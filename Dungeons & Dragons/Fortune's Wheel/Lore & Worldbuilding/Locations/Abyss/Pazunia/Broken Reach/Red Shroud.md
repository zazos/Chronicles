> *It is a nearly impossible task to construct an accurate history of a fiend. Part of this difficulty lies in the fact that fiends, like all of the true planar races, are immortal and tend not to feel the need to physically record their life events; they rely instead on their incredible memories. While this is true of all the planeborn, the natives of the Lower Planes face other problems which also serve to prevent them from giving in to the vanity of creating journals of their lives. All of these difficulties are other fiends. Not only do they have to worry about their racial enemies in the vast Blood War, they must also be on the watch for the machinations of members of their race – from both above and below the fiend’s current station. And finally, there are the near-infinite numbers of wizards (mainly clueless Primes) who seek to summon a fiend away from the Outer Planes and into magical slavery. Any piece of information that is known about a fiend is seen as a weakness. No one knows when it could prove to be a liability, or lead to a fatal downfall._*

> *So, instead of tumbling to the truth from its private memoirs, a sage most turn instead to two other – mostly unreliable – sources of information when creating a chronicle of a fiend and its deeds. The first is the fiend itself; specifically, whatever information it chooses to reveal about itself in conversation. However, any darks garnered from this source had best used very sparingly; remember that every fiend suffers from acute paranoia when it comes to personal information. Anything that is said is a half-truth at best, and an outright lie most of the time. The other source of information is from the histories of people and places that the fiend has interacted with. This chant is almost as equally unreliable as the words from the fiend’s mouth. This is because the teller is usually uncertain as to the true identity of the being with which he dealt, or else is biased with extreme hatred at the results of the fiend’s actions. Fortunately, the truth is more easily distilled from these histories simply due to the sheer volume that exists after so many centuries of the fiend’s existence. It is thus much easier to find common threads and self-confirming facts in that haystack.*

# History

The succubus called Red Shroud is one of those rare tanar’ri whose name is well-known both in and out of the Abyss. Outside of her home plane the Shroud has a tri-fold reputation among planewalkers, especially those who fall on the lower end of the moral spectrum. The fiend’s primary claim to fame in this circle is her position as the dictator of the [**Abyss**](https://mimir.net/planes/abyss/)‘ gate-town to the Outlands, [**Broken Reach**](https://mimir.net/places/broken-reach/). But Red Shroud is almost equally respected (or feared) for being both an expert in the brewing (and use) of poisons as well as being a fairly reliable source of the chant on the Great Ring. While these skills also earn her some fame in the Abyss, Red Shroud is widely known throughout her home plane (as well as many of the other Lower Planes) for her role as one of the leaders of an infamous group of succubi known as the [**Original Sins Cartel**](https://mimir.net/culture/organisations/original-sins-cartel/).

Red Shroud readily admits to having existed for two millennia. However, given how widely her skill at poisons is known throughout the [**Abyss**](https://mimir.net/planes/abyss/), this age should be taken as a minimum. (Another reason to consider her far older than her given age is the fact that the succubus holds a position of some importance and influence in the Abyss, and thus has cause to trick potential enemies into underestimating her abilities.) In addition to the mystery surrounding her true age, her origins are also unknown. Red is canny enough to not give any clues as to whether she pulled herself fully formed from the raw Chaos and Evil that makes up the landscape of the Abyss, or if she worked her way up from origins as a simple larva. Either way, spending at least two thousand years as a tempter of mortals is a strong indication of her force of will and abilities.

It is during these early centuries that Red Shroud honed her talents as a poisoner, which she puts to great use in luring mortal souls to the Abyss. Only fledgling succubi rely solely on their personal talents to tempt mortals to their dooms. Eventually, these tanar’ri find some form of tool that can be used to supplement their innate abilities and increase their chances of success. Most often, these tools are a form of magic that can be used to hide their true identities and intentions. The Shroud turned to poison as a means to force mortals to corrupt and destroy themselves, allowing her to harvest their souls quicker and easier. The fiend has long since moved beyond poisons which damage the mortal body. Instead, she creates and uses poisons which directly harm the mind or soul, twisting the mortal’s beliefs until he damns himself through his own actions. Red Shroud also makes extensive use of “reverse diplomacy”. She likes to find out all the dirty secrets she can about her intended victim, and then see to it that his friends and family learn them so that they might turn against him. This skill at the poisoning of relationships has also served Red well in surviving the turbulent political structure of the Abyss. It is no coincidence that those who seek to harm the succubus find their allies suddenly turning against them at a critical moment.
