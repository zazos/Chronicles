## Web of Deceit and Fire

### Premise:

[[Valyndra.webp|Valyndra]], an Erinyes of vicious beauty and precise cruelty, sees the Original Sins Cartel (OSC) as a dangerous thorn in the side of the Nine Hells. Although the Abyss is always in conflict with the Hells, the Cartel’s increasing control of the soul trade in the Abyss threatens to upset a fragile balance. Furthermore, Valyndra’s Archdevil master harbours a deep-seated enmity toward Graz’zt, who indirectly benefits from the Cartel through Maretta's casino in Azzagrat. To serve her master’s will—and to gain personal favour—Valyndra needs her warlock to act as an agent of chaos, subtly destabilizing the Cartel without outright declaring war.

### Step 1: The Mission from Valyndra

Valyndra meets the warlock under any circumstance, either via dream-like trance or physically. Her words are a seductive whisper, but the message is clear:

> "My chosen... There is a festering blight in the Abyss, a network of serpents with ambitions far too grand for their standing. The Cartel must be severed from within, their delicate alliances shattered. You will be the blade I wield in the darkness, but you must strike quietly, unnoticed. There is one, Nari, who is ripe for manipulation—use her lust for power, her ambitions, and her arrogance. Through her, the entire Cartel may be brought to its knees. Fail me not, my beloved tool, for the fires of my wrath are far greater than the Abyss itself."

---

### Step 2: Understanding the Cartel's Inner Workings

The warlock must first gather intel about the Original Sins Cartel. Valyndra could direct them to find a demonologist, a scholar of Abyssal politics, or a bitter outcast willing to betray the Cartel’s secrets. From this NPC, the warlock will learn about the fragile alliances within the Cartel, especially the precarious position of [[Nari_Succubus.png|Nari, the Favoured]], who is a rising star but a mere tool for the others. Nari’s hunger for power and growing suspicion of her own status can be exploited.

---

### Step 3: Creating a Pact with Nari

The warlock’s goal is to gain Nari’s trust, subtly nudging her toward betrayal. They could approach her by impersonating an ally or broker a meeting through Valyndra's influence. The offer is simple:

> _**"Assist in usurping the Cartel’s power, and in return, gain exclusive rights to the souls Nari will claim once she’s in charge."**_

Nari will likely demand proof of the warlock’s power, such as the removal of Maretta_, whose ties to Graz’zt make her a formidable opponent. This sets the stage for a more direct confrontation with a key Cartel member.

---

### Step 4: Sowing Discord

While manipulating Nari, the warlock must also subtly pit the other Cartel members against each other. Tactics could include:

- **Exploiting Red Shroud’s Paranoia:** Plant the idea that Nari is planning a coup.
- **Leaking forged documents or rumours** suggesting that Meerena or Saskia is planning to double-cross the Cartel.

These actions should heighten tensions and drive wedges between the members.

---

### Step 5: Nari’s Betrayal

At the right moment, Nari will attempt to eliminate a rival like Maretta. Valyndra’s true goal, however, is for Nari to fail spectacularly, leading to chaos and backstabbing within the Cartel. The warlock can fan the flames of distrust, ensuring the Cartel's internal conflict spirals out of control.

---

### Step 6: The Aftermath

With the Cartel in disarray, Valyndra's true intentions are revealed. The warlock’s patron has orchestrated this entire plot to seize control of the soul trade. The warlock’s success could lead to great rewards, but failure could result in being hunted by the most dangerous succubi in the Abyss, including a vengeful Nari.

---

### Possible Twists

- **Nari’s Double Betrayal:** Nari could be manipulating the warlock from the start, planning to sacrifice them once she's in power.
- **A Sudden Ally:** A Cartel member (e.g., _**Latana**_ or _**Safira**_) may offer the warlock a counter-deal to destroy Nari in exchange for a share of the soul trade.
- **Valyndra’s Ambition:** The warlock might uncover that Valyndra is also a pawn in her Archdevil master’s schemes, prompting questions of loyalty.
