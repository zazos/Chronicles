[[Fortunes Wheel emergence point.webp|Show To Players]]
#### Backstory about the emergence point:
Nestled behind a **dilapidated shrine to Aulasha**, a long-forgotten goddess of memory and prophecy, now defunct. The shrine sits within a gated garden a block away from **Fortune’s Wheel**, overlooked by passing nobles and untouched by restoration crews.

A **sealed stone well**, capped with a heavy iron hatch engraved with **Harmonium** and **Fraternity of Order** sigils. Locals know it as “The Dreaming Lock”—rumored to lead into forgotten ruins or nightmares. Officially, it was barred decades ago following a **madness outbreak** traced to dream-eaters emerging from the depths.

A narrow, winding spiral descent connects to Undersigil. The Harmonium once stationed guards here, but the ward's elite found the patrols unsightly. Now it’s forgotten—except by smugglers, secret societies, and the desperate.

# To Fortune's Wheel

*As you climb the last rung of the rusted ladder and force open the forgotten hatch, you push up into a crumbling shrine. The ceiling is collapsed, vines and cobwebs coat old pews, and the dust of decades swirls around them.*

*A Harmonium patrol passes nearby on the street outside—but they don't seem to notice you.*

 *You step through an overgrown arch, brushing aside ivy and there it is: Fortune's Wheel, in all its gilded, garish glory.*

The door of Fortune's Wheel opens into the Dragon Bar. When they enter, a polite, snappily dressed tiefling bellhop named [[Valek.webp|Valek]] delivers a letter to them that read as follows:

> Honoured guests,
> Welcome! I’ve been expecting you. Don’t fret; you’re safe here. Our city’s so-called “peacekeepers” hold no sway in my establishment. 
> 
> I’ve prepared accommodations for each of you upstairs. Valek will show you to your rooms. Rest, relax, and enjoy room service on me. When you’re ready for entertainment, a gift awaits you at the casino cage. 
> 
> I’ll be down a bit later. See you soon. 
> 
> Your benignant host, 
> Shemeshka 



Describe the swirl of exotic perfumes, the soft glow of planar symbols in stained-glass windows, and the sense that every eye in the room flicks to them as they cross the threshold.

Introduce them to what they see at the ground floor [[Fortune's Wheel#F1 Dragon Bar]]


[[Valek.webp|Valek]] shows the characters to their rooms: luxurious suites fit for royalty on the second floor. A clean set of fine clothes awaits each character.

Valek caters to their basic needs, offering to shine equipment, answer questions about the casino, or provide a short tour.
With the characters in Valek’s capable hands, Josbert wishes the characters good luck and departs the casino. 


### Planar Proprietor

Shemeshka’s reputation precedes her. Characters who question Josbert, Valek, or other locals about her might learn the following details: 
- **Arcanaloth**. Shemeshka is an influential arcanaloth who takes pride in her appearance. She owns Fortune’s Wheel and appears in the casino regularly.
- **Influencer**. She’s fantastically wealthy and an information broker par excellence. 
- **Spy Master**. Powerful in her own right, Shemeshka also commands a loyal web of spies that could bring the city’s factions to their knees overnight.

### The Fortune's Wheel

[[Fortune's Wheel]]

# Here Comes the Queen

Once the PCs have slipped into appropriate attire, they descend into the glittering depths of Fortune’s Wheel. 

*The casino’s hushed hum of anticipation greets them—cards clacking, dice tumbling, and the soft glow of enchanted lights dancing across marble floors. Allow the party a few moments to explore: to test their luck at the gaming tables, observe the floating roulette wheels, and examine the patrons whispered rumors swirl around.*

After the players have settled into the rhythm of the casino, all eyes turn as Shemeshka makes her entrance.

*The grand chandelier’s lights dim briefly, then flare brighter as Shemeshka descends the central staircase, every silken fold of her gown catching the glow. The chatter in Fortune’s Wheel hushes to a reverent murmur as all eyes fix upon her.*

> “Welcome, cherished patrons—though you already know who I am. I am Shemeshka, Queen of the Crosstrade, and every thrill you chase tonight exists by my design. Fortune’s Wheel is more than a game hall; it is my gift to you—pleasure, profit, and possibility all woven into one dazzling tapestry. Should you seek whispers of value or refuge from your rivals, my doors are always open—provided you remember that every favor carries its cost. Enjoy the night, and let us see whose ambitions shine brightest under my watch.”

*After a while a contingent of Harmonium officers bursts through the casino doors, weapons at the ready, scanning the crowd for the party’s faces. Murmurs ripple through the hall as the officers advance, drawing stares from every gambler. In that tense moment, Shemeshka steps between the PCs and their would-be captors. With a languid bow, she offers the Harmonium a priceless secret—information that would delight the Guvners but means nothing to her. In exchange, she insists the officers lay off her new acquaintances and cover their debts for the evening. The Harmonium grudgingly accepts the bargain, and the officers depart, grumbling but bound by Shemeshka’s concession.*


## Commotion


_Trigger._ The moment at least **half the party** steps within 15 ft of any duodrone slot machine.

 *Static ripples off the party like heat-haze. The four duodrone croupiers stiffen, optic lenses spinning. The illusion-coins in the golden fountain freeze in midair, then duplicate, then fork outward as if reality can’t decide where to place them.*

**Reading the Parchment or Leaving the Casino**

### USING THE PARCHMENT AS PORTAL

- As soon as a character unfolds or reads the parchment aloud, the coordinates activate.

**Sensory Description (Text) **

*The parchment’s ink shimmers, numbers pulsing with a strange, harmonic resonance. The air vibrates—first gently, then with a jarring snap. All around you, the casino’s illusions flicker and peel away, exposing raw, shifting architecture beneath. Chandeliers rattle. Slot machines spew coins and sparks. The golden fountain freezes mid-cascade, droplets suspended in fractured time.*

*Above the chaos, a vertical wound splits the air—a gaping portal to Mechanus yawns open, gears grinding and cosmic law pouring through like a cold wind. The whirring, metallic order of Mechanus clashes violently with the casino’s riotous colors, reality itself buckling under the strain.*

*In the eye of this storm stands Shemeshka, perfectly still atop her balcony. Firelight dances on her crimson silks and razor-sharp grin. Her two eyes, molten gold and unblinking, pin you in place—ancient, calculating, and utterly unforgiving. You feel her gaze burn into your soul, as if branding you for some future reckoning.*

*As the portal’s gears begin to turn, threatening to consume the entire hall, the parchment in your hand pulses with desperate urgency. Cascading numbers spill from its surface, wrapping around your vision. The world lurches. For a single, infinite heartbeat, you are everywhere—Sigil’s skyline, the casino’s golden glow, the cold machinery of Mechanus, and then—*

*—green fields, endless and wild, beneath a sky that spirals with impossible colors. You land, breathless, in the Outlands. The coordinates from the parchment blaze in your mind, pointing your gaze toward a distant, impossible silhouette: the Walking Castle.*

- R0AM is either “caught” by Shemeshka’s planar security, or the glitch forcibly separates him to prevent further narrative contamination.
