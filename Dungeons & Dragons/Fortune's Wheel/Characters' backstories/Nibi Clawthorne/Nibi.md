# BACKSTORY

Σημείωση: Γενικά δεν έχω ιδέα σε ποια περιοχή έχει μεγαλώσει η Nibi ως Forest Gnome. Δεν μπόρεσα να βρω πληροφορίες για το που υπάρχουν ακριβώς.

  

## RAISED IN THE FOREST (Birth to 20)

  

Nibi Clawthorne grew up hidden away in a small gnome village deep buried in a thick forest. She is the daughter of Torick Clawthorne, a gnome cleric of Baervan Wildwanderer and Koemi Trickfoot, a former gnome fighter adventurer. She also has two sisters, one of which is her twin. Orla is the twin and Tuts their younger sibling. Nibi and Orla are 5 years older than Tuts. 

Nibi was a hyperactive little trickster that went around playing pranks and tricks to anyone she came across. Orla was always dragged along in her schemes and when Tuts was old enough, they included her in their mischievous plans, spreading chaos around the village. When they did not go around causing havoc, Nibi and Orla would observe their mother’s training sessions. It was their favorite part of the day. That and when Koemi would tell them stories of her adventures before bed time. Both of them had a weakness towards their mother. And both had decided from an early age that they would one day become fighters just like Koemi. And then perhaps the three of them could go around and see the world and keep discovering its wonders for the rest of their lives.

Those hopes and dreams came crashing down when one day, at the age of thirteen, the three siblings awoke to the sound of their father crying. Nibi was the first to dare go to their parents room and find Torick sitting on the floor, crying and holding his head between his hands, with a letter left on the floor in front of him. Nibi picked it up and read it. Her mother’s elegant writing and the faint scent of her rose perfume, decorated the hurtful words of her letter. 

  

I can not do this anymore. Every passing day my heart aches for more. Everyday I wither inside, bit by bit, like a delicate helpless flower. You know that is not who I am. I am sorry. But this is for the best. Goodbye

  

No one saw this coming. Except maybe from their dad. Nibi could tell when she looked into his eyes. He knew this day would come. And now he was paying the price. 

Tuts never really recovered from this. Neither did their father. Orla and Nibi were the only ones that still held on to hope. The hope of their mother coming back, realizing her mistake. If she didn’t come for them, they vowed they would go look for her and bring her back. Still, deep inside doubt was born and as the years passed, it grew bigger. Because at the end of the day, they both wanted to know the reason she abandoned them. If they ever met her, they would ask her why.

Even though Nibi had made a plan with her sister about going after their mother once they were older, she couldn’t lie to herself and say her mother’s departure didn’t hurt her. One day she decided to go to their favorite place, under the big oak tree next to the lake near their village and imagine her mother braiding her hair. She cried for the first time since Koemi left them. She cried out and called for her mom to come back and love them again, but no one answered. Or no one she was expecting. She suddenly felt something wet touching her face. She opened her eyes and in front of her was a small gecko of light pink and white colors. Her little new friend made her laugh and forget for a bit her troubles. After calming down she returned to her home. To her surprise, the little gecko had followed her all the way back. She tried setting it free and letting it go back to the forest, but it always found a way back to her. She didn't fight it anymore and let it be. It became her best friend and stayed with her all her life. She named it Τσιχλόφουσκα.

  

(Τσιχλόφουσκα seems to be some sort of magical gecko. Just because it is with her, even when we will start the campaign. 55 years later and it seems to haven’t aged a bit. And is all well and good up until the present.)

  

## ADULTS AND TRAINING ARC (20 to 25)

  

The years passed them by and the siblings grew. Tuts became closer to their dad and became a cleric herself, helping him with his job. Nibi and Orla were now at the age of 20, and they thought it was time they left. Leave the village behind and execute their plan. They wanted to go in search of a fighter’s guild and train hard, in order to be able to stand on equal levels as their mother, for when they would find her. First problem with that though, was talking to their father and sister about it.

The talk happened and as Nibi was expecting, it was not taken well. Nibi had never seen her father getting angry, much less disappointed. That day he became both. He didn’t even try to talk it out with them. Instead he simply said Get out. And don’t ever come back.

Tuts tried to reason with him and calm him down, but it was in vain. She too was angry at her older sisters, but she wasn’t as cold as their father. His gaze was cold and he seemed like he didn’t want to have anything to do with them anymore. He left their house that day to go and pray. Not once did he turn to look at his daughters. Nibi and Orla hugged their sister goodbye and departed, never looking back either. 

  

**Εδώ δεν ξέρω που να της βάλω να πάνε. Απλώς θα έγιναν μέλος κάποιας φρουράς ή κάποιας ακαδημίας πολεμιστών?? Δεν ξέρω εάν υπάρχει κάτι τέτοιο. Αλλά θα πρέπει να περάσουν κάποιο είδους training κάποιων χρόνων και μετά να θα έχουν την τελική εξέταση για το εάν θα μπουν στην παράταξη αυτή ή όχι. 

  

They join a fighter’s guild together. They want to train first and grow stronger before going after their mother.

In total they spend 5 years of their lives training and trying to advance through the ranks or training, in order to graduate and become real soldiers. Nibi was the top student of her year and by far better than Orla. For Nibi it was natural. Orla on the other hand had to put in a lot of effort to be able to keep up. And even that wasn’t enough. So Orla began getting jealous of Nibi. She became so jealous and obsessed with being better than her sister, that her behavior towards her changed in the last two years. Nibi refused to see it. Her blissful state would not last for long though.

On the day of their final exam, Orla decided to sabotage her sister. She found a way to hex her before their exam day, leading to Nibi completely failing at all of her tests. Nibi couldn’t even fathom that her sister was behind it. She was convinced she could only blame herself for not being good enough. Orla though made sure she knew. Her words cut Nibi like a sword could cut up her flesh. Orla admitted that she wanted Nibi to fail, so she could take her place and get in. She kept repeating how much she hated Nibi and how glad she was that now only one of them could prove to their mother that they were worthy of her love. She made sure Nibi knew how finally, Orla was the one that surpassed her and that now Nibi would be no one. Nibi then retorted back the most hurtful words she could think of at that moment. After having failed the exam, she left. She would find their mother on her own.

  

## TRAVELING ALONE (25 to 30)

  

Nibi was on her own, traveling around for about 5 years, joining adventure group after adventure group. But all was in vain. She never found any clues about the whereabouts of her mother. Occasionally she took year breaks at her home, in her village, at her sister’s house. Her sister apparently had met a guy named Orion and they were living together. They seemed to be in love and they were constantly talking about having a family of their own in the future. Nibi during those years slowly rebuilt her relationship with her father. It was not the same as it was before, but it had improved a lot. After those 5 years, she decided to give up her search for her mother. 

  

## SETTLING DOWN IN WATERDEEP (30 to 40)

  

On her last trip she came upon the city of Waterdeep and decided to settle down there. She got tired of going around looking for a mother that does not want to have anything to do with her. So many years had passed already, she would not waste any more on her. She tried finding a place to work but no one seemed to hire her as a guard. She promised that she could keep them safe, plead even at points for a chance. It did not work out. Until she came upon the Woods of Joy. A toy store run by a family of rock Gnomes. Chetney and his son Raine. They would take her in and teach her the ways of wood carving, hiring her as a helper instead of a guard. She spent 10 years in waterdeep, getting to know her new family. She also became really good friends with Raine. Raine was her best friend and they spent a lot of time together those 10 years. In the last 3, they also started dating.

From time to time, Nibi would get letters from her sister Tuts. The most shocking letter was the one letting Nibi know that she would be an aunt soon. Nibi did not know how to feel about that. To her, it never occurred that she wanted to become a mother. The more she thought about it, the more the reason why became clear to her. She truly believed she would not be a good mother. She was convinced that she would be as bad a mother as Koemi was. Maybe even worse. And she would not put anyone through what they had been through. That is why she could not understand how Tuts wanted to be one. She figured she would never understand.

Tuts became a mother at the age of 30 and Nibi an aunt at the age of 35. Nibi did go to visit them after the babies were born. Once when the first born boy, Lark was born and a second time the following year after the birth of Sparrow, the baby girl. They seemed small and helpless. And strangely they seemed to like Nibi. She chose not to stick around for long. She felt uncomfortable around them. Surely she would do something to disappoint them. Or maybe even hurt them. What if she dropped one while holding it? She did not want to have that kind of responsibility. She would love them from afar.

  
  
  
  

## AUNT MOM ARC (40 to 45)

  

Sometimes though, the unexpected comes knocking at your door. So at the age of 40, Tuts shows up at her doorstep, her two kids behind her. Then a bizarre request escaped her sister’s lips.

I need you to look after my kids, no questions asked.

Nibi owned her own house in the city of Waterdeep and it was big enough for one person. It could easily host two kids at the age of 5. But there was no way Nibi would be able to take care of those two fragile things. She tried to refuse but Tuts was already on her way after kissing her kids goodbye.  
I swear, I will explain all of this one day. Please. Just keep them safe. I will be back for them.

And just like that she was gone.

For the next 5 years Nibi ended up raising her two nephews. Boy oh boy, were they a pain in the ass. Not because they were badly behaved or anything. Just because Nibi had no idea what she was doing. Sure they were little rascals, causing chaos all over the house when they were hyped about something. But at least, they did help around in the end. They were also a pain in the ass because they reminded Nibi of herself, when her own mother left her behind. Despite being young, she could see it in their eyes. The loneliness, the worry and the sadness. After that, she made a promise to herself. She would be the best aunt mom she could to these kids. She vowed to give them what her own mother couldn’t. And she did try her best.

5 years under her care, she still had no news from Tuts. Their father hadn’t heard from her either. Nibi found it strange. There was something very wrong about this ordeal. She couldn't think of a single reason as to how Tuts could leave them behind for so long. Especially without sending any word. 

In those last five years though, she became even closer with Raine. They started dating and spending time together. Raine even came around to play with the kids and look after them when Nibi had to attend to her own responsibilities.

All went wrong though on that fateful night.

  

**When they disappear, lark is 10 and Sparrow 9. At the start of the campaign, if they are still alive, they would be 15 and 14.

  

## NIGHT OF TURNING (50)

  

She and Raine had gone out for a date and Nibi had hired a babysitter for the kids. She and Raine said their goodbyes at the end of the night and Nibi made her way to her home. The first thing she noticed was that the door was half open. The second thing was the silence. It wasn't that late and Lark and Sparrow usually waited up for her to come back, so she could tell them one of her stories before bed. The third thing she noticed was the smell of iron in the air. She entered her house, pushing the front door open. The walls were covered in claw marks. Blood spots decorated various walls of the first hallway. In front of her was a fresh trail of blood. She  walked further in, in denial as to what was unveiling in front of her. She came upon a spectacle of horror. A wolf-like creature seemed to be occupied by eating someone in front of it. Nibi grabbed a nearby broom. All those years she spent training would amount to something she hoped. She tried sneaking up, stepping as lightly as she could master with her nerves. But the creature turned. Two red eyes gazed at her. Lust and hunger behind them. A hunger she would later be familiar with. It jumped at her. 

Nibi dodged and rolled to the side, hitting it with the broom. It broke. Panicked, she ran to the living room to grab her sword. When she was centimeters away from grasping it, she felt an excruciating pain coming from her shoulder. She turned her head and saw the wolf-like creature was biting her with all its might. That is it for her, she thought. This was the moment she died. 

A loud howl broke the silence. 

The werewolf in front of her released her and turned its head towards the source of the howl. It stastood for a few seconds before it dashed away. Nibi felt her whole body being on fire and the pain sending shock waves down her spine. 

Losing no more time, she grabbed her sword and scouted around her house. First stop, the body in the hallway. Orion. Her hands shook and she vomited, as she could barely recognize him. All of his body, apart from his face, was mutilated. She almost lost her balance too after she regained her composure from the vomiting. She continued on. She went up to the second floor, to check up on the kids. On the way, she found the body of the babysitter too. She almost vomited a second time. But she held it in. She then heard noises nearby. From the kids’ room. She approached slowly and as silently as she could. In a swift move, she opened the door and was ready to pierce whatever was on the other side. She froze. She saw her sister. Tuts. 

Tuts was bleeding out in front of her, a huge claw wound on her belly, her intestines falling out. Nibi knelt down and held her baby sister in her arms. Tuts looked at her and smiled softly, caressing her older sister’s face, trying to comfort her.

Hey sis… Sorry… it took… this long.

 Nibi was crying uncontrollably. She shook her head and let Tuts know she would get help. She just needed to hold on. But Tuts shook her head. They both knew that there was no time left for her. Through shallow breaths, Tuts tried to tell her something.

The kids… Find…them. Take care of… my… babies… Not their fault.

Tuts coughed up blood.

She kept it…. secret… She… Mom is-

Before she could say anything more, her hands fell to her side and her head fell down idle. Lifeless.

Nibi’s abnormal cries filled up the emptiness and silence of her house as she held on to the dead body of her baby sister. She mourned and her heart was ripped to a thousand pieces. The pain of loss overcame the pain on her shoulder. She was completely numb. She felt like she wouldn’t recover from this,

She rolled on the side, an attack connected to the floor, where she sat before. Her sharp instincts took over unconsciously. She looked up and she saw a dark tall humanoid figure, standing by the bedroom door, with a sword lit on fire. They locked eyes. The sword’s flames dimed down and the man moved fast towards her. They danced around, Nibi dodging and the stranger attacking. Soon though she got tired and slipped. Then all faded to black.

She woke up in a cage. In front of her is the man from before. She now could see that he was partially elf-like. From looking around her, she noticed they were out in some kind of forest, next to a campfire. The stranger introduced himself as Aerendir Thornwood. A blood hunter, member of the order of the Lycan. He explained to her that she got infected by a werewolf and sooner or later she would be turning into one. He gave her a choice. She could swear that she would never hurt any creature and partake in a ritual that would give her the opportunity to control the beast. Or, she could die right now by his blade. Nibi was confused. She didn’t understand anything and she started crying. The loss of her sister was too fresh on her mind. He then explained in more detail what happened to her. She would turn into one of those monsters if she didn’t choose. And he would make sure he would not let her live if that happened. As she would be a danger to everyone around her. He gave her more details as to how the infection worked. He also let her know how her life will be from now on, should she choose to keep the beast at bay. 

Nibi took some time to think about it. She then agreed, a darkness overcoming her as she thought about saving her sister’s kids. She would do anything to find them and bring them back. And for that to happen, she had to remain alive.

Under his instructions she went through the hunter’s bane and survived it.

  

## IN SEARCH OF THE KIDS, BLOOD HUNTER NETWORKING

  

They spend five years together traveling around, trying to find leads for her missing nephews. She  shares with him her life story and what happened when he found her. During that time, Nibi learns the ways of the blood hunter and studies hemocraft from Aeredir. They also travel all over Faerun, slaying and studying monsters and expanding their contacts all over the place. Aeredir rarely takes her with him when he goes out to fight the said monsters. The few times he does though, it is for Nibi to study them and start to get familiar with how to fight them. She begins keeping notes and is determined to write her own book about the creatures she encounters. Her fear had turned into fascination about the abnormalities of this world, as well as for the weird beasts that exist out there.

 As for her werwolf status, she still struggles to tame it, but she has gotten better at it than from the start.  

A point comes though, when they have to go their separate ways. Aeredir is called by the order to return for a specific mission and Nibi can not follow him. Because she needs to find out what happened with her family and where her nephews are. She wants to make sure they are safe. And if not, at least to find out what happened to them.

That is when she goes on her way and we get caught up with her when the campaign starts.

# PERSONALITY

Confident and sassy, Nibi is best described as rebellious and surprisingly foxy. A lot of playfulness comes out as well when she feels close with someone. She is openly defiant of authorities, having little to no respect for laws and authority in general. 

That probably derives from her gnomish nature, having lived free and without rules for her younger days. Even when she was training to become a fighter, she was struggling to blindly follow orders. Her exceptional talent got her out of tight situations, whenever she tried to question her higher ups. That aspect of her personality, completely got free when she failed the exams. She had also tried informing the guild about the injustice that had taken place, but they simply shrugged it off. By the rules it was fair game and she was expelled fair and square. Nibi since then refuses to conform to anyone’s set of rules, is a rebel at heart, has her own moral code but doesn’t indulge in anarchy despite her wild nature.

Coming to reinforce her defiance for laws, was her years traveling around with Aerendir. Despite his serious appearance, Nibi sometimes strongly believed the guy was a fraud. Often a drunk and a charlatan, a lousy flirt and an awful jockster, she could not fathom how he had survived so far. If she hadn’t seen him fight, she would have left him the moment she met him. At least his charlatan-like personality made her be more true to herself. She could let go and be like her old self from time to time, despite the heavy weight on her shoulders, of finding her kids. He was also kind. Despite trying to hide it from her. He always looked out for her and made sure she was taken care for. He could also hold his ground in serious conversations and was a really good listener. They got along really well.

She has a caring side to her and she is willing to protect the people she holds most dear. She is afraid of losing friends, and as such tries to ignore the idea of them leaving. She is also very forgiving. She will get mad at you and get back at you with small harmless pranks, but in the end she doesn’t want to keep being upset with someone for long.

 She is a free spirit. Nibi lives for the moment, and while she is an outcast of society, she lives her life without caring about what others think of her. She embraces her quirks and does not let others bring down her weirdness. Occasionally she also gets easily distracted. 

 She is also always confident In her abilities, but never really comes off as arrogant and can accept when she has been bested.

On the other hand, Nibi can become extremely stubborn as well. If she thinks she is right about something, she will not let it go. That has led her sometimes to go ahead on her own and do what she thinks is best. She can also stop listening to what the other person has said in these moments. She doesn’t like being told what to do and as a result she often does the opposite, trying to get back at the person that commanded something out of her that way. 

That means she is also very proudful, and rarely backs down from defending her opinions and it can come off as her being closed minded. That is not the case. She is just used to people not taking her seriously just because she is small. And she despises that. But in the end, her forgiving nature does let her think about her stances when she has found time to calm down.

# DM’s QUESTIONS

  

- Ποια ηταν η μεγαλυτερη αποφαση ή καμπη της ζωης του χαρακτήρα σου; Αν επαιρνε μια διαφορετικη αποφαση, πως θα ηταν διαφορετικη ζωη του; Πως θα ηταν διαφορετικη η ζωη του αν εκανε επιλογες με βαση τις προσδοκίες των αλλων;

  

Η μεγαλύτερη καμπή θα έλεγα πως χωρίζεται σε 3 μεγάλες στιγμές, οι οποίες όρισαν την Νίμπι. Η εγκατάλειψη από την μητέρα της, η προδοσίας της Όρλας και ο θάνατος της Τούτς. Από αυτά όμως το μεγαλύτερο impact είχε ο Θάνατος της Tuts και η μόλυνση της με lycanthropy.  
  
Η ζωή της θα μπορούσε να ήταν διαφορετική σαν τρια παράλληλα outcomes, με βάση αυτά τα 3 μεγάλα γεγονότα στην ζωή της. Οπότε ανάλογα την διαφορετική απόφαση, θα είχε διαφορετικό outcome σε 3 στάδια της ζωής της  
  

1. Θα είχε περάσει το υπόλοιπο της ζωής της στο χωριό, εάν η μητέρα της έμενε. Πιθανό να είχε ακολουθήσει και τα χνάρια του πατέρα της, με το να γίνει cleric σαν εκείνον και την αδερφή της
    
2. Θα είχε γίνει τοπ πολεμίστρια στο guild που είχε προσπαθήσει να γίνει μέλος και η ζωή της ίσως ακολουθούσε το μονοπάτι ενός στρατιώτη. Έτσι δεν θα έφτιαχνε ποτέ την σχέση με τον πατέρα της. Ίσως να είχε φτιάξει και την σχέση της με την Όρλα εάν καταλάβαινε νωρίτερα το τι περνούσε η αδερφή της.
    
3. Θα προσπαθούσε να πείσει παραπάνω την Tuts να της πει τι συμβαίνει για να την βοηθήσει. Έτσι η Τούτς δεν θα είχε πεθάνει και τα παιδιά της θα είχαν ακόμα τους γονείς τους. Εάν επίσης δεν αναγκαζόταν να ακολουθήσει το μονοπάτι του blood hunter, στην αναζήτησή της για τα εγγόνια της, θα είχε παντρευτεί με τον Raine και ίσως είχε και τα δικά της παιδιά. 
    

  

Οι προσδοκίες των άλλων εάν την είχαν επηρεάσει, θεωρώ πως θα είχε ως αποτέλεσμα την πρώτη περίπτωση. Θα ήταν κληρικός σαν τον πατέρα της, προστατεύοντας το χωριό τους και τους κατοίκους του, σιγουρεύοντας πως και η φύση γύρω τους, καθώς και οι κάτοικοί της, να ήταν ασφαλείς. 

- Ποιο ειναι κατι που ο χαρακτηρας σου εύχεται να μπορουσε να αλλαξει στον εαυτο του; Πως θα ηταν διαφορετικη η καλυτερη αυτη εκδοχη του εαυτου του; (Μπορει να μην υπαρχει και καλυτερη φυσικα)

  
  

Δεν ξέρω εάν θεωρείται σαν χαρακτηριστικό, αλλά σίγουρα θα ήθελε η Νίμπι με κάποιο τρόπο να γιατρέψει την κατάρα της. Τουλάχιστον στην φάση που είμαστε, δεν έχει αποδεχτεί ακόμα το τέρας μέσα της. Αντιθέτως το φοβάται. Από τότε που το κόλλησε, ο μόνος άνθρωπος που ήταν μαζί της ήταν ο Έρεντιρ. Κάθε φορά που έχανε τον έλεγχο, ήταν εκεί να την συνεφέρει. Τώρα που είναι μόνη της, φοβάται πως θα κάνει κακό σε κάποιον εάν της ξεφύγει ο έλεγχος. Πιστεύει δηλαδή, ότι εάν δεν υπάρχει η κατάρα της, θα μπορέσει να νιώσει ήρεμη. Δεν έχει πιστέψει δηλαδή το ότι θα μπορέσει ποτέ να αποδεχτεί την πτυχή της αυτή, όπως της λέει ο Έρεντιρ. 

Γενικά όμως, η Νίμπι θεωρεί επίσης πως θα ήταν καλύτερη εάν ήταν ψηλότερη. Γιατί θεωρεί πως έτσι θα την πάρουν όλοι στα σοβαρά. Εάν δηλαδή ήταν όσο ψηλή όσο ο Έρεντιρ, σίγουρα κανείς δεν θα την αμφισβητούσε. Αυτό βέβαια έρχεται και δένει με το γεγονός πως κατά βάθος, για να το σκέφτεται αυτό, η ίδια αμφισβητεί τον εαυτό της. Παρόλο που δεν θέλει να το παραδεχτεί. Πιστεύει στις ικανότητές της ως πολεμίστρια, γιατί πέρασε σχεδόν όλη την ζωή της στο να γίνει καλύτερη, αλλά δεν της είναι αρκετό. Αυτό λοιπόν εύχεται να μπορούσε να αλλάξει για να είναι καλύτερη. Να νιώσει αρκετή έτσι όπως είναι. Να την δουν όλοι ως την πιο δυνατή πολεμίστρια που είναι, παρόλο που είναι gnome. 

Επίσης και το να σταματήσει να διώχνει τους ανθρώπους μακριά της. Έχει μια τάση να θυσιάζει τον εαυτό της σε επικίνδυνες καταστάσεις, για να σιγουρέψει πως εάν κάτι πάει λάθος και χάσει τον έλεγχο, θα πεθάνει πριν κάνει κακό σε κάποιον άλλον. Θα ήταν καλύτερη εάν μπορούσε να εμπιστευτεί ξανά τους γύρω της αλλά και τον εαυτό της. 

  
  
  

- Ποιο ειναι το χαρακτηριστικο ή το φυσικο χαρακτηριστικο του χαρακτηρα σου το οποιο θα μεινει αναλλοίωτο, ανεξαρτητα απο το τι θα μπορουσε να ειχε συμβει στη ζωη του; (Αν αυτο υπαρχει)

  

Ένα χαρακτηριστικό που δεν θα αλλάξει ποτέ είναι το γεγονός ότι θα θυσιαζοταν για τους δικούς της ανθρώπους. Έχοντας χάσει τα αδέλφια της με τον έναν ή τον άλλον τρόπο, τα ανίψια της, την μητέρα της και τον Raine που έπρεπε να το αφήσει για να είναι αφαλής, δεν θέλει με την καμία να αφήσει τα άτομα γύρω της να πάθουν κακό. Εάν περνάει από το χέρι της, θα τους προστατεύσει πάση θυσία.

Σύμφωνα και με την προηγούμενη ερώτηση, κάτι που θα άλλαζε ανάλογα τις περιστάσεις στην ζωή της, είναι να αποδεχτεί τον εαυτό της έτσι όπως είναι. Να αγαπήσει την άλλη μορφή της και να σταματήσει να την πολεμάει. Και να σταματήσει να φοβάται. Να γίνει η γεμάτη αυτοπεποίθηση και γενναία Νίμπι που ξέρει ότι μπορεί να είναι. 

Όπως επίσης και να αφήσει τους άλλους να την προστατεύσουν με την σειρά τους θα μπορούσε να αλλάξει. Να δει δηλαδή πως δεν χρειάζεται να τα κάνει όλα εκείνη και πως μπορεί να βασιστεί και σε άλλους.
