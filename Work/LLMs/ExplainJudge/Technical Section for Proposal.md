The proposed pipeline implements a three-stage architecture for explainable AI validation, designed to provide transparent and auditable model explanations. **xAI Processing** employs domain-appropriate techniques (SHAP, LIME, Grad-CAM, or DALEX, etc) to extract feature attributions from the target model. These outputs are structured into standardized JSON payloads containing feature importance scores, prediction confidence intervals, and instance-level contribution mappings.
The **Narrative Generator** component utilizes a fine-tuned **Narrator LLM** to transform structured xAI outputs into domain-specific natural language explanations. This model incorporates domain lexicons (e.g., SNOMED-CT for healthcare), regulatory-compliant phrasing templates, and context-aware templating. Domain adaptation is achieved through parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which enables precise translation of technical outputs into accessible narratives while minimizing retraining overhead.
**Automated Validation** employs a **Judge LLM** leveraging DeepEval’s GEval framework with rule-based validation modules. This component evaluates explanations against configurable quality pillars: contextual accuracy (cross-verified against knowledge bases), operational safety (hazard phrase detection), and actionability (required element extraction). The Judge LLM undergoes criteria-specific fine-tuning focused on evaluation rubrics, bias mitigation techniques, and scoring consistency across edge cases. Unlike the Narrator, it benefits more from preference optimization (DPO) than domain-specific training. Validation metrics undergo threshold comparison (e.g., pass ≥ 0.8), with failures triggering safety mechanisms and feedback-loop optimization.
This system employs a scalable cloud-based architecture. A single Judge service handles all domains via API, communicating with domain-specific Narrator instances. The implementation prioritizes parameter-efficient methods (LoRA/PEFT) for Narrator fine-tuning to accommodate domain-specific adaptations without excessive computational resources, while the Judge leverages generalized evaluation capabilities enhanced through task-specific prompting.
